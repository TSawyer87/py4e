- **input**: Get data from the “outside world”. This might be reading data from a file, or even some kind of sensor like a microphone or GPS. In our initial programs, our input will come from the user typing data on the keyboard.
- **output**:Display the results of the program on a screen or store them in a file or perhaps write them to a device like a speaker to play music or speak text.
- **sequential execution**: Perform statements one after another in the order they are encountered in the script.
- **conditional execution**: Check for certain conditions and then execute or skip a sequence of statements.
- **repeated execution**: Perform some set of statements repeatedly, usually with some variation.
- **reuse**: Write a set of instructions once and give them a name and then reuse those instructions as needed throughout your program.

The “art” of writing a program is composing and weaving these basic elements together many times over to produce something that is useful to its users.

The word counting program above directly uses all of these patterns except for one.
