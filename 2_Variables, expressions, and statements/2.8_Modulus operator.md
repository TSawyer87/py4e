- The *modulus operator* works on integers and yields the remainder when the first operand is divided by the second.
- In Python the modulus operator is the percent sign (%).
```
>>> quotient = 7 // 3
>>> print(quotient)
2
>>> remainder = 7 % 3
>>> print(remainder)
1
```
So 7 divided by 3 is 2 with 1 left over.

- The modulus operator is very useful. You can check whether one number is divisible by another: if x % y is zero, then x is divisible by y.
- You can also extract the right-most digit or digits from a number. For example x % 10 yields the right-most digit of x (in base 10)
- Similarly, x % 100 yields the last two digits.
