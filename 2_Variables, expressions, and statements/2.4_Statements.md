- A **statement** is a unit of code that the Python interpreter can execute.
- There are expression statements, assignment statements, print statements.

- A script usually contains a sequence of statements.
- If there is more than one statement, the results appear one at a time as the statements execute.
For example, the script:
```
print(1)
x = 2
print(x)
```
Produces the output
```
1
2
```
The assignment statement produces no output
