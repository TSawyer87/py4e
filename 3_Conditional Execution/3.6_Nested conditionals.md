- One conditional can also be nested within another.
We could have written the three-branch like this:
```
if x == y:
    print('x and y are equal')
else: 
    if x < y:
        print('x is less than y')
    else:
        print('x is greater than y')
```
The outer conditional contains two branches.
- The first branch contains a simple statement.
- The second branch contains another if statement, which has two branches of its own.

Nested If Statements
- Although the indentation of the statements makes the structure apparent, nested conditionals become difficult to read very quickly. It's best to avoid them when possible.

Logical operators often provide a way to simplify nested conditional statements.
For example, we can rewrite the following code using a single conditional:
```
if 0 < x:
    if x < 10:
        print('x is a positive single-digit number.')
```
The print statement is executed only when we pass both conditionals. 
We can get the same effect with the and operator:
```
if 0 < x and x < 10:
    print('x is a positive single-digit number.')
```
