- Sometimes there are ore than two possibilities and we need more than two branches. One way is to express a computation like a *chained conditional*:
```
if x < y:
    print('x is less than y')
elif x > y:
    print('x is greater than y')
else:
    print('x and y are equal')
```
-  elif is an abbreviation of "else if." Again, exactly one branch will be executed.

- There is no limit to the number of elif statements. 
- If there is an else clause, it has to be at the end, but there doesn't have to be one.
```
if choice == 'a':
    print('Bad guess')
elif choice == 'b':
    print('Good guess')
elif choice == 'c':
    print('Close, but not correct')
```
