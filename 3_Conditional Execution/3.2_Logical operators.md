- There are three *logical operators*: **and, or**, and **not**.
- The semantics (meaning) of these operators is similar to English:
```
x > 0 and x < 10  # only true if x is greater than 0 and less 
                  # than 10
n%2 ==0 or n%3 ==0  # is true if either of the conditions are true
                    # that is if the number is divisible by 2 or 3.

not (x > y)      # is true if x > y is false
                 # that is if x is less than or equal to y
```
- Strictly speaking, the operands of the logical operators should be boolean expressions, but Python is not very strict.
- Any nonzero number is interpreted as "true":
```
>>> 17 and True
True
```
