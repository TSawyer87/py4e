- Tags tend not to do much more than mark the beginning and end of an element.
- Elements are the bits that make up web pages.
- You would say, for example, that everything that is in between (and includes) the `<body>` and `</body>` tags is the body element. As another example, whereas “`<title>`” and “`</title>`” are **tags**, “`<title>Rumple Stiltskin</title>`” is a title **element**.
