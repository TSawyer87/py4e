- You can emphasize text in a paragraph using `em ` (emphasis) and `strong` (strong importance).
```html
<p>Yes, that really <em>is</em> exciting. <strong>Warning:</strong> level of excitement may cause head to explode.</p>
```

> [!NOTE]
> Traditionally, browsers will display [`em`](https://www.htmldog.com/references/html/tags/em/) in italics and [`strong`](https://www.htmldog.com/references/html/tags/strong/) in bold by default but they are not the same as [`i`](https://www.htmldog.com/references/html/tags/i/) and [`b`](https://www.htmldog.com/references/html/tags/b/) tags which (although they have been tenuously redefined in HTML5) have their origins in italic and bold - remember - HTML isn’t for presentation. If you want to emphasize something visually (making something italic, for example), you almost certainly want to give it general emphasis. You can’t speak in italics.
