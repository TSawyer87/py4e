- All HTML pages should have a page **title**.

To add a title to your page, change your code so that it looks like this:
```html

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>My first web page</title>
</head>
<body>
    This is my first web page
</body>
</html>
```
- We have added two new elements here, that start with the head tag and title tag.

- The head element appears before the body element and contains info **about** the page.
- The info in the head element doesn't appear in the browser window but the tab above.
