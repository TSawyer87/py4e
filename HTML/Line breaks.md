- The line-break tag can also be used to separate lines like this:
```html
This is my first web page<br>
How exciting
```
- There's no content involved in breaking lines so there is no closing tag.

> It could be tempting to over-use line breaks and [`br`](https://www.htmldog.com/references/html/tags/br/) shouldn’t be used if two blocks of text are intended to be separate from one another (because if that’s what you want to do you probably want the [`p`](https://www.htmldog.com/references/html/tags/p/) tag).
