#HTTP
In this chapter we will pretend to be a web browser and retrieve web pages using the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). Then we will read through the web page data and parse it.

- The network protocol that powers the web is actually quite simple and there is built-in support in Python called socket which makes it very easy to make network
Connections and retrieve data over those sockets in a Python program.
