To find the largest value in a list or sequence, we construct the following loop:
```
largest = None
print('Before:', largest)
for itervar in [3, 41, 12, 9, 74, 15]:
    if largest is None or itervar > largest:
        largest = itervar
    print('Loop:', itervar, largest)
print('Largest:', largest)
```

```

Before: None
Loop: 3 3
Loop: 41 41
Loop: 12 41
Loop: 9 41
Loop: 74 74
Loop: 15 74
Largest: 74
```
- The variable **largest** is best thought of as the "largest value we have seen so far".
- We set **largest** to **None** to mark the variable as "empty".

- While the loop is executing, if **largest** is **None** then we take the first value we see as the largest so far.
- You can see in the first iteration when the value of **itervar** is 3, since largest is **None**, we immediately set **largest** to be 3.
- Since **largest** is no longer **None**, the second part of the compound logical expression that checks **itervar** > **largest** triggers only when we see a value that is larger than the "largest so far"
- When we see a new “even larger” value we take that new value for largest.
- You can see in the program output that largest progresses from 3 to 41 to 74.
- At the end of the loop, we have scanned all of the values and the variable largest now does contain the largest value in the list.

To compute the smallest number, the code is very similar with one small change:
In:
```
smallest = None
print('Before:', smallest)
for itervar in [3, 41, 12, 9, 74, 15]:
    if smallest is None or itervar < smallest:
        smallest = itervar
    print('Loop:', itervar, smallest)
print('Smallest:', smallest)
```
Out:
```
Before: None
Loop: 3 3
Loop: 41 3
Loop: 12 3
Loop: 9 3
Loop: 74 3
Loop: 15 3
Smallest: 3

```

- Again, **smallest** is the "smallest so far" before, during, and after the loop executes.
- When the loop has completed, **smallest** contains the minimum value in the list.

Again as in counting and summing, the built-in functions **max** () and **min**() make writing these exact loops unnecessary.

The following is a simple version of the Python built-in min () function:
```
def min(values):
    smallest = None
    for value in values:
        if smallest is None or value < smallest:
            smallest = value
    return smallest
```
- In the function version of the smallest code, we removed all of the **print** statements so as to be equivalent to the min function which is already built into Python.

Here is a function to find the smallest number in a list:
```
def find_smallest(data):
    """Finds the smallest number in a list of numbers.

    Args:
        data: A list of numbers

    Returns:
        The smallest number in the list
    """
    smallest = None
    for itervar in data:
        if smallest is None or itervar < smallest:
            smallest = itervar
    return smallest

```

And a function to find the largest:
```
def find_largest(data):
    """Finds the largest number in a list of numbers

    Args:
        data: A list of numbers

    Returns:
        The largest number in the list

    """
    largest = None
    for itervar in data:
        if largest is None or itervar > largest:
            largest = itervar
    return largest


# And an example using it

data = [3, 41, 12, 9, 74, 15]

largest_number = find_largest(data)

print('Largest:', largest_number)

Largest: 74
```

Key Takeaways:
- Finding Largest/Smallest Value in a List

- The flag variable, named largest or smallest, keeps track of the "current biggest" or "current smallest" value seen so far in the loop iterations.

- It starts as None to indicate no value has been encountered yet.
- The loop iterates through each element (itervar) in the list.
    For finding the largest:
        If largest is None (first iteration) or the current element (itervar) is greater than largest, it updates largest to the current element.
    For finding the smallest:
        It's similar to finding the largest, but the condition checks if itervar is less than smallest.

Benefits of Built-in Functions:

- The text highlights that Python provides built-in functions like max() and min() for finding the largest and smallest values, respectively.
- These functions are generally more concise and efficient than writing custom loops.

Code Examples:

    The text showcases the custom loop approach for both finding largest and smallest values.
    It then presents a simplified version of the min() function implemented with a loop (equivalent to the smallest value finding code).
    Finally, it demonstrates well-defined functions find_smallest and find_largest that encapsulate the logic for reusability and readability.

In Summary:

The text effectively explains how to find the largest/smallest value in a list using a loop and emphasizes the advantages of using built-in functions like max() and min(). It also provides well-structured function examples for better code organization
