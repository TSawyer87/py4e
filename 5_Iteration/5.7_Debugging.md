#Debugging 

As you write bigger programs, debugging takes longer.

One way to cut your debugging time is "debugging by bisection"
- For example, if there are 100 lines in your program and you check them one at a time, it would take 100 steps.
- Instead, try to break the problem in half
- Look for a middle point for an intermediate value you can check.
- Add a print statement ( or something else that has a verifiable effect) and run the program.
- If the mid-point check is incorrect, the problem must be in the first half of the program
- If it is correct, the problem is in the second half.
- Every time you do this you halve the number of lines you have to search
- After six steps, you would be down to one or two lines of code, at least in theory.
