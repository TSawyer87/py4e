- When you have a list of things to loop through, you can construct an *definite* loop using a **for** statement.
- We call the **while** statement an *indefinite* loop because it simply loops until some condition becomes **False**, wheras the **for** loop is looping through a known set of items so it runs through as many iterations as there are items in the set.

The syntas of a **for** loop is similar to a **while** loop in that there is a **for** statement and a loop body:
```
friends = ['Joseph', 'Glenn', 'Sally']
for friend in friends:
    print('Happy New Year:', friend)
print('Done!')
Happy New Year: Joseph
Happy New Year: Glenn
Happy New Year: Sally
Done!
```
- The variable **friends** is a list of three strings and the **for** loop goes through the list and executes the body once for each of the three strings in the list.
- Translating this for loop to English is not as direct as the while, but if you think of friends as a set, it goes like this: “Run the statements in the body of the for loop once for each friend in the set named friends.”

Looking at the **for** loop, *for* and *in* are reserved Python keywords, and **friend** and **friends** are variables.
```
for friend in friends:
    print('Heppy New Year:', friend)
```
- **friend** is the *iteration variable* for the for loop.
- The variable **friend** changes for each iteration of the loop and controls when the **for** loop completes.
- The *iteration variable* steps successively through the three strings stored in the **friends** variable.
