Often we use a **for** or **while** loop to go through a list of items or the contents of a file and we are looking for something such as the largest or smallest value of the data we scan through.

These loops are generally constructed by:
- Initializing one or more variables before the loop starts.
- Performing some computation on each item in the loop body, possibly changing the variables in the body of the loop.
- Looking at the resulting variables when the loop completes.
