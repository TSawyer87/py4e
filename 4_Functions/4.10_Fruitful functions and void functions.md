#Functions 

- Some functions, such as math functions yield results; we'll call them *fruitful functions*.
- Other functions, like print_twice, perform an action but don't return a value, they're called *void functions*.

 When you call a fruitful function, you almost always want to do something with the result; for example you might assign it to a variable or use it as part of an expression:
 ```
 x = math.cos(radians)
 golden = (math.sqrt(5) + 1) / 2

 # When called in interactive mode...
 >>> math.sqrt(5)
 2.23606797749979

 # But in a script it computes the sqrt of 5, but
 # since it doesn't store it or display it its
 # useless
 math.sqrt(5)
 ```

Void functions might display something on the screen or have some other effect, but they don't return a value.
- If you try to assign the result to a variable, you get a special value called **None**.
```
>>> result = print_twice('Bing')
Bing
Bing
>>> print(result)
None
# None is a special value that has its own type:
>>> print(type(None))
<class 'NoneType'>
```

To return a result from a function, we use a **return** statement in our function.

For example we could make a simple function called **addtwo** that adds two numbers together and returns the results:
```
def addtwo(a, b):  # parameters are a & b
    added = a + b  # local function variable added
    return added

x = addtwo(3, 5)  # parameters
print(x)          # print the sum of 3 & 5
8
```

When this script executes, the print statement will print out “8” because the
Addtwo function was called with 3 and 5 as arguments. Within the function, the
Parameters a and b were 3 and 5 respectively. The function computed the sum of
The two numbers and placed it in the local function variable named added. Then
It used the return statement to send the computed value back to the calling code
As the function result, which was assigned to the variable x and printed out.
