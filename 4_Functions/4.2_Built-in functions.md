#Functions 
- Python provides a number of important built-in functions that we can use without needing to provide the function definition.
The **max** and **min** functions give us the largest and smallest values in a list, respectively:
```
>>> max('Hello world')
'w'
>>> min('Hello world')
' '
>>>
```
- The **max** function tells us the "largest character" in the string (which turns out to be the letter "w").
- The **min** function shows us the smallest character (which turns out to be a space).

Another very common built-in function is the **len** function which tells us how many items are in its argument. 
```
>>> len('Hello world')
11
>>> 
```
- These functions can operate on any set of values, not only strings...
