#Strings 

A segment of a string is called a *slice*.

Selecting a slice is similar to selecting a character:
```
>>> s = 'Monty Python'
>>> print(s[0:5])
Monty
>>> print(s[6:12])
Python
```
- The operator returns the part of the string from the "n-th" character to the "m-th" character, including the first but excluding the last.
- If you omit the first index (before the colon), the slice starts at the beginning of the string.
- If you omit the second index, the slice goes to the end of the string:
```
>>> fruit = 'banana'
>>> fruit[:3]
'ban'
>>> fruit[3:]
'ana'
```

If the first index is greater than or equal to the second the result is an *empty string*, represented by two quotes:
```
>>> fruit = 'banana'
>>> fruit[3:3]
''
```

- An empty string contains no characters and has length 0, but other than that, it is the same as any other string.
