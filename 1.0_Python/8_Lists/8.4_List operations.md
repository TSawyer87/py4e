#Lists 

The + operator concatenates lists:
```python
>>> a = [1, 2, 3]
>>> b = [4, 5, 6]
>>> c = a + b
>>> print(c)
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
```

The * operator repeats a list a given number of times:
```python
>>> [0] * 4    # repeat 4 times
[0, 0, 0, 0]
>>> [1, 2, 3] * 3   # repeat list 3 times
[1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3]
```
