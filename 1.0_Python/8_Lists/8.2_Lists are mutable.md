#Lists 

The syntax for accessing the elements of a list is the same as for accessing the characters of a string: the bracket operator. 
```
print(cheese[0])
Cheddar
```

Unlike strings, lists are mutable because you can change the order of items in a list or reassign an item in a list.
- When the bracket operator appears on the left side of an argument, it identifies the element of the list that will be assigned.
```
numbers = [17, 123]
numbers[1] = 5
print(numbers)

[17, 5]
```
- The one-th element of **numbers**, which used to be 123 is now 5.

You can think of a list as a relationship between indices and elements.
- This relationship is called *mapping*; each index "maps to" one of the elements.

List indices work the same as string indices:
- Any integer expression can be used as an index.
- If you try to read or write an element that doesn't exist, you get an **IndexError**.
- If an index has a negative value, it counts backward from the end of the list.

The **in** operator also works on lists.
```
cheeses = ['Cheddar', 'Edam', 'Gouda']
'Edam' in cheeses
True
'Brie' in cheeses
False
```
