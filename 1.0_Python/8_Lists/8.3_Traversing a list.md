#Lists

The most common way to traverse the elements of a list is with a **for** loop.
```python
for cheese in cheeses:
    print(cheese)
```

This works well if you only need to read the elements of the list. But if you want to write or update the elements, you need the indices. A common way to do that is to combine the functions **range** and **len**:
```python
for i in range(len(numbers)):
    numbers[i] = numbers[i] * 2
```
- This loop traverses the list and updates each element.
- **len** returns the number of elements in the list.
- **range** returns a list of indices from 0 to n - 1, where *n* is the length of the list.
- Each time through the loop, i gets the index of the next element.
- The assignment statement in the body uses **i** to read the old value of the element and assign the new value.

A **for** loop oer an empty list never executes the body:
```python
for x in empty:
    print('This never happens.')
```

Although a list can contain another list, the nested list still counts as a single element. The length of this list is four:
```python
['spam', 1, ['Brie', 'Roquefort', 'Pol le Veq'], [1, 2, 3]]
```
