#Lists 

Like a string, a list is a sequence of values.
- In a string, the values are characters.
- In a list, they can be any type.
- The values in a list are called *elements* or sometimes *items.* 

There are many ways to create a new list; the simplest is to enclose the elements in square brackets [ ] 
```
[10, 20, 30, 40]
['crunchy frog', 'ram bladder', 'lark vomit']
```
- The first example is a list of four integers.
- The second is a list of three strings.
- The elements of a list don't have to be the same type..
```
['spam', 2.0, 5, [10, 20]]   # [10, 20] 
                            # nested list
```

- A list within another list is *nested*.
- You can create an empty list with empty brackets [].

You can assign list values to variables:
```
cheeses = ['Cheddar', 'Edam', 'Gouda']
numbers = [17, 123]
empty = []
print(cheeses, numbers, empty)
```
`Out:`
`['Cheddar', 'Edam', 'Gouda'] [17, 123] []`
