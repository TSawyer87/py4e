When reading a file it's common to want to find the "interesting lines" and then *parse* the line to find some interesting *part* of the line.

Say we wanted to pring out the day of teh week from those lines that start with "From".

The **split** method is very effective when faced with this kind of problem. We can
Write a small program that looks for lines where the line starts with “From”, **split**
Those lines, and then print out the third word in the line:
```
fhand = open('mbox-short.txt')
for line in fhand:
    line = line.rstrip()
    if not line.startswith('From '): continue
    words = line.split()
    print(words[2])
```
