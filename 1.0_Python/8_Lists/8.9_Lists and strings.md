#Lists #Strings 

- A string is a sequence of characters.

- A list is a sequence of values.

- But a list of characters is not the same as a string.

To convert from a string to a list of characters, you can use **list**:
```
s = 'spam'
t = list(s)
print(t)

['s', 'p', 'a', 'm']
```
- Since **list** is the name of a built-in function, don't use it as a variable name.
- Also avoid the letter "l" because it looks too much like the number "1". Use "t"

The **list** function breaks a string into individual letters. 

If you want to break a string into words, you can use the **split** method:
```
s = 'pining for the fjords'
t = s.split()
print(t)
['pining', 'for', 'the', 'fjords']
print(t[2])

the
```
- Once you have used **split** to break the string into a list of words, you can use the index operator to look at a particular word in the list.

You can call **split** with an optional argument called a *delimiter* that specifies which characters to use as word boundaries.

The following uses a hyphen as a delimiter:
```
# In:
s = 'spam-spam-spam'
delimiter = '-'
s.split(delimiter)

# Out:
['spam', 'spam', 'spam']
```


**join** is the inverse of **split**.
- It takes a list of strings and concatenates the elements.
- **join** is a string method, so you have to invoke it on the delimiter and pass the list as a parameter:
```
t = ['pining', 'for', 'the', 'fjords']
delimiter = ' '
delimiter.join(t)

# Out:
'pining for the fjords'
```
- In this case the delimiter is the space character, so **join** puts a space between words.
- To concatenate strings without spaces, you can use the empty string, "", as a delimiter.
