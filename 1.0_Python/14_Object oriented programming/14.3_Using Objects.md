#OOP 

Python provides us with many built-in objects.
```python
stuff = list()  
stuff.append('python')  
stuff.append('chuck')  
stuff.sort()  
print (stuff[0])  
print (stuff.__getitem__(0))  
print (list.__getitem__(stuff,0))
```

Instead of focusing on what these lines accomplish, let's look at what is really happening from the point of view of object-oriented programming.
- The first line constructs an object of type **list**, 
- the second and third lines call the `append()` method,
- the fourth line calls the `sort()` method,
- and the fifth line *retrieves* the item at position 0.
- The sixth line calls the `__getitem__()` method in the **stuff** list with a parameter of zero.
- `print (stuff.__getitem__(0))`
- The seventh line is an even more verbose way of retrieving the 0th item in the list.
- `print (list.__getitem__(stuff,0))`
- In this code, we call the `__getitem__` method in the **list** class and *pass* the list and the item we want to retrieve from the list as parameters.

The last three lines of the program are equivalent, but it is more convenient to  
simply use the square bracket syntax to look up an item at a particular position  
in a list.  
We can take a look at the capabilities of an object by looking at the output of the  
dir() function:
```python
>>> stuff = list()  
>>> dir(stuff)  
['__add__', '__class__', '__contains__', '__delattr__',  
'__delitem__', '__dir__', '__doc__', '__eq__',  
'__format__', '__ge__', '__getattribute__', '__getitem__',  
'__gt__', '__hash__', '__iadd__', '__imul__', '__init__',  
'__iter__', '__le__', '__len__', '__lt__', '__mul__',  
'__ne__', '__new__', '__reduce__', '__reduce_ex__',  
'__repr__', '__reversed__', '__rmul__', '__setattr__',  
'__setitem__', '__sizeof__', '__str__', '__subclasshook__',  
'append', 'clear', 'copy', 'count', 'extend', 'index',  
'insert', 'pop', 'remove', 'reverse', 'sort']  
>>>
```
