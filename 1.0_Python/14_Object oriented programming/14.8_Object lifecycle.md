#OOP 

In the previous examples, we define a class(template), use that class to create an instance of that class(object), and then use the instance.
- Usually we don't think much about the creation and destruction of variables, but often as our objects become more complex, we need to take some action within the object to set things up as the object is constructed and possibly clean things up as the object is discarded.

If we want our object to be aware of these moments of construction and destruction, we add specially named methods to our object:
```python
class PartyAnimal:
    x = 0

    def __init__(self):
        print('I am constructed')

    def party(self):
        self.x = self.x + 1
        print('So far',self.x)

    def __del__(self):
        print('I am destructed', self.x)

an = PartyAnimal()
an.party()
an.party()
an = 42
print('an contains',an)
```

```python
In [2]: an = PartyAnimal()
I am constructed

In [3]: an.party()
So far 1

In [4]: an.party()
So far 2

In [5]: an = 42
I am destructed 2

In [6]: print('an contains',an)
an contains 42

```

- As Python constructs our object, it calls our `__init__` method to give us a chance to set up some default or initial values for the object.

When Python encounters the line:
```python
an = 42
```
- It actually "throws our object away" so it can reuse the `an` variable to store the value `42`.
- Just at the moment when our `an` object is being "destroyed" our destructor code `__del__` is called.
- We can't stop our variable from being destroyed, but we can do any necessary cleaning before our object no longer exists.

When developing objects, it is quite common to add a constructor to an object to set up initial values for the object. It is relatively rare to need a destructor for an object.
