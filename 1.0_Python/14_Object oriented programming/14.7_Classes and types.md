#OOP 

As we have seen, in Python all variables have a type. We can use the built-in dir function to examine the capabilities of a variable. We can also use type and dir with the classes that we create.
```python
class PartyAnimal:
    x = 0

    def party(self) :
        self.x = self.x + 1
        print("So far", self.x)

an = PartyAnimal()
print ("Type", type(an))
print ("Dir ", dir(an))  
print ("Type", type(an.x))  
print ("Type", type(an.party))
```

Output:
```python
Type <class '__main__.PartyAnimal'>  
Dir ['__class__', '__delattr__', ...  
'__sizeof__', '__str__', '__subclasshook__',  
'__weakref__', 'party', 'x']  
Type <class 'int'>  
Type <class 'method'>
```
- You can see that using the class keyword, we have created a new type. 
- From the `dir` output, you can see both the x integer attribute and the `party` method are available in the object.
