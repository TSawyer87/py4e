#OOP

At the beginning of this book, we came up with four basic programming patterns which we use to construct programs:  
• Sequential code  
• Conditional code (if statements)  
• Repetitive code (loops)  
• Store and reuse (functions)

As we build programs, we design data structures and write code to manipulate those data structures.

As programs get to be millions of lines long, it becomes increasingly important to write code that is easy to understand.
- You could never keep a million-line program in your head at the same time.
- We need ways to break large programs into multiple smaller pieces so that we have less to look at when solving a problem, fix a bug, or add a new feature.

In a way object oriented programming is a way to arrange your code so that you can zoom into 50 lines of the code and understand it while ignoring the other 999,950 lines of code for the moment.
