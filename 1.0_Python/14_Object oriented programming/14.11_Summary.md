#OOP 

At this point you should fully understand whats going on here:
```python
stuff = list()
stuff.append('python')
stuff.append('chuck')
stuff.sort()
print (stuff[0])
print (stuff.__getitem__(0))
print (list.__getitem__(stuff,0))
```

# Following along with Dr. Chuck in class
Programs are a bunch of objects that are orchestrated together.
- Objects hide detail - they allow us to ignore the detail of the "rest of the program"
- An interfaces defines contracts that a class must implement
- The actual code behind something that seems simple like python lists is actually around 2,500 lines of code to make it work.
**Class** (cookie-cutter)- a template: Defines the abstract characteristics of a thing (object), including the thing's characteristics (its attributes,fields or properties) and the things behaviors (the things it can do, methods,operations or features). One might say that a class is a blueprint or factory that describes the nature of something.


**Method or Message** - A defined capability of a class: 
- In language, **methods** are verbs.
- Lassie, being a Dog, has the ability to bark. So bark() is one of Lassie's methods.
- She may have other methods as well, for example sit() or eat() or walk() or save_timmy().
- Within the program, using a method usually affects only one particular object; all Dogs can bark, but you need only one particular dog to do the barking.Method < == > Message


**Field or attribute** - A bit of data in a class


**Object or Instance** -(cookie) A particular instance of a class or particular object: The instance is the actual object created at runtime.
- In programmer jargon, the Lassie object is an instance of the Dog class.
- The set of values of the attributes of a particular object is called its `state`
- The object consists of state and behavior that's defined in the object's class.Object < == > Instance
```python
x = 'abc'
type(x)
<class 'str'>
type(2.5)
<class 'float'>
type(2)
<class 'int'>
y = list()
type(y)
<class 'list'>
z = dict()
type(z)
<class 'dict'>
```

```python
dir(x)
```

```python
class PartyAnimal:
    def __init__(self):
        self.x = 0
    def party(self):
        self.x = self.x + 1
        print("So far",self.x)

an = PartyAnimal()

an.party()   # tell the an object to run the party() code
an.party()
an.party()
```
- class is a reserved word that defines a template for making objects
- Each PartyAnimal object has a bit of code
- When the object is constructed, a specially named method is called to allocate and initialize attributes
