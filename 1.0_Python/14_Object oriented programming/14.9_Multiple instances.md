#OOP 

So far, we have defined a class, constructed a single object, used that object, and then thrown the object away. However, the real power in object-oriented programming happens when we construct multiple instances of our class.

When we construct multiple objects from our class, we might want to set up different initial values for each of the objects. We can pass data to the constructors to give each object a different initial value:
```python
class PartyAnimal:
    x = 0
    name = ''
    def __init__(self, nam):
        self.name = nam
        print(self.name,'constructed')

    def party(self):
        self.x = self.x + 1
        print(self.name,'party count',self.x)

s = PartyAnimal('Sally')
j = PartyAnimal('Jim')

s.party()
j.party()
s.party()
```
Output:
```python
Sally constructed
Jim constructed
Sally party count 1
Jim party count 1
Sally party count 2
```

- The constructor has both a `self` parameter that points to the object instance and additional parameters that are passed into the constructor as the object is constructed:
```python
s = PartyAnimal('Sally')
``` 

Within the constructor, the second line copies the paramerer `nam` that is passed into the `name` attribute within the object instance.
```python
self.name = nam
```
