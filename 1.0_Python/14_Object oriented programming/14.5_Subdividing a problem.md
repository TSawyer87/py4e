#OOP 

One of the advantages of the object-oriented approach is that it can hide complexity.
- For example, while we need to know how to use the `urllib` and BeautifulSoup code, we do not need to know how those libraries work internally.
- This allows us to focus on the part of the program we need to solve and ignore the other parts of the program.

This ability to focus exclusively on the part of the program that we care about and ignore the rest is also helpful to the developers of the objects that we use.
