#Dictionaries 

If you use a dictionary as the sequence in a for statement, it traverses the keys of the dictionary. This loop prints each key and the corresponding value:
```python
counts = {'chuck':1,'annie':42,'jan':100}
for key in counts:
    print(key, counts[key])
```
`Out:`
```python
jan 100
chuck 1
annie 42
```
- Again, the keys are in no particular order.

We can use this pattern to implement the various loop idioms that we have described earlier.

For example if we wanted to find all the entries in a dictionary with a calue above ten, we could write:
```python
counts = {'chuck':1,'annie':42,'jan':100}
for key in counts:
    if counts[key] > 10:
        print(key, counts[key])
```

The **for** loop iterates through the *keys* of the dictionary, so we must use the index operator to retrieve the corresponding *value* for each key.
Here's the output:
```python
jan 100
annie 42
```
- We see only the entries with a value above 10.

> If you wanted to print the keys in alphabetical order. 

- first make a list of the keys in the dict using the **keys** method available in dictionary objects.
- Then sort that list and loop through the sorted list looking up each key and printing out key-value pairs in sorted order as follows:
```python
counts = { 'chuck' : 1 , 'annie' : 42, 'jan': 100}
lst = list(counts.keys())
print(lst)
lst.sort()
for key in lst:
print(key, counts[key])
```
`Out:`
```python
['jan', 'chuck', 'annie']
annie 42
chuck 1
jan 100
```
- First you see the list of keys in unsorted order that we get from the **keys** method.
- Then we see the key-value pairs in order from the **for** loop.

**Alternative Approach (Sorting In-Place):**

While the provided solution sorts keys into a separate list, you can also achieve alphabetical order within the original loop using the `sorted` function directly:

Python

```python
counts = {'chuck': 1, 'annie': 42, 'jan': 100}
for key in sorted(counts.keys()):
  print(key, counts[key])
```
