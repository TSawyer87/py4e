#Dictionaries 

Often dictionaries are used to count the occurrences of words in a file.
- We'll start with a simple file of the words taken from the text of *Romeo and Juliet* in a shortened and simplified version with no punctuation.
```
But soft what light through yonder window breaks
It is the east and Juliet is the sun
Arise fair sun and kill the envious moon
Who is already sick and pale with grief
```
Our program will read through the lines of the file.
- Break each line into a list of words.
- Then loop through each of the words in the line and count each word using a dictionary.

We will use two `for` loops, the outer loop is reading the lines of the file and the inner loop is iterating through each of the words on each line.
- This pattern is called *nested loops* because one loop is the *outer* loop and one loop is the *inner*.
- Since the inner loop executes all of its iterations each time the outer loop makes a single iteration, we think of the inner loop as iterating "more quickly" and the outer loop more slowly.

The combination of the two nested loops ensures that we will count every word on every line of the input file.
```python
fname = input('Enter the file name: ')
try:
    fhand = open(fname)
except:
    print('File cannot be opened:', fname)
    exit()
counts = dict()
for line in fhand:
    words = line.split()
    for word in words:
        if word not in counts:
            counts[word] = 1
        else:
            counts[word] += 1

print(counts)
```

`Out:`
```bash
python3 count1.py
Enter the file name: romeo.txt
{'and': 3, 'envious': 1, 'already': 1, 'fair': 1,
'is': 3, 'through': 1, 'pale': 1, 'yonder': 1,
'what': 1, 'sun': 2, 'Who': 1, 'But': 1, 'moon': 1,
'window': 1, 'sick': 1, 'east': 1, 'breaks': 1,
'grief': 1, 'with': 1, 'light': 1, 'It': 1, 'Arise': 1,
'kill': 1, 'the': 3, 'soft': 1, 'Juliet': 1}
```
- It's a bit inconvenient to look through the dictionary to find the most common words and their counts.
- So we need to add some more Python code to get us the output that will be more helpful.
