#Databases 
Once we know the key value for both the Twitter user and the friend in the JSON,
it is a simple matter to insert the two numbers into the Follows table with the following code:
```python
cur.execute('INSERT OR IGNORE INTO Follows (from_id, to_id) VALUES (?, ?)', (id, friend_id) )
```

- We let the db keep us from "double-inserting" by creating a table with a uniqueness constraint & adding `OR IGNORE` to our `INSERT` statement.
`Out:`
```python
Enter a Twitter account, or quit:
No unretrieved Twitter accounts found
Enter a Twitter account, or quit: drchuck
Retrieving http://api.twitter.com/1.1/friends ...
New accounts= 20 revisited= 0
Enter a Twitter account, or quit:
Retrieving http://api.twitter.com/1.1/friends ...
New accounts= 17 revisited= 3
Enter a Twitter account, or quit:
Retrieving http://api.twitter.com/1.1/friends ...
New accounts= 17 revisited= 3
Enter a Twitter account, or quit: quit
```

We started with the drchuck account and then let the program automatically pick
the next two accounts to retrieve and add to our database.
The following is the first few rows in the People and Follows tables after this run
is completed:
```python
People:
(1, 'drchuck', 1)
(2, 'opencontent', 1)
(3, 'lhawthorn', 1)
(4, 'steve_coppin', 0)
(5, 'davidkocher', 0)
55 rows.
Follows:
(1, 2)
(1, 3)
(1, 4)
(1, 5)
(1, 6)
60 rows.
```
