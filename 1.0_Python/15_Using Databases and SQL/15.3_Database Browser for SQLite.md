#Databases 

Using the browser you can easily create tables, insert data, edit data, or run simple  
SQL queries on the data in the database.  
In a sense, the database browser is similar to a text editor when working with text  
ﬁles. When you want to do one or very few operations on a text ﬁle, you can just  
open it in a text editor and make the changes you want. When you have many  
changes that you need to do to a text ﬁle, often you will write a simple Python  
program. You will ﬁnd the same pattern when working with databases. You will  
do simple operations in the database manager and more complex operations will  
be most conveniently done in Python
