# Representing Simple Strings

- Each character is represented by a number between 0 & 256 stored in 8 bits of memory
- We refer to "8 bits of memory" ad a "byte" of memory
- the `ord()` function tells us the numeric value of a simple ASCII character
```python
print(ord('H'))
72
print(ord('e'))
101
print(ord('\n'))
10
```
- It's just important to know that all letters refer to a number

# Multi-Byte Characters
- To represent the wide range of characters computers must handle we represent characters with more than one byte
**UTF-16** Fixed length - Two bytes
**UTF-32** Fixed length - Four bytes
**UTF-8** 1-4 bytes
- Upwards compatible with ASCII
- Automatic detection between ASCII and UTF-8
- UTF-8 is recommended practice for encoding data to be exchanged between systems.

```python
x = b'abc
type(x)
<class 'bytes'>
```


# **Python Strings to Bytes**
- When we talk to an external resource like a network socket we send bytes, so we need to encode Python3 strings into a given character encoding
- When we read data from an external resource, we must decode it based on the character set so it is properly represented in Python3 as a string
```python
while True:
    data = mysock.recv(512)
    if ( len(data) < 1 ) :
        break
    mystring = data.decode()
    print(mystring)
```
- In this example the variable `data` is bytes and the variable `mystring` is unicode.

## An HTTP Request in Python
```python
import socket

mysock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
mysock.connect(('data.pr4e.org', 80))
cmd = 'GET http://data.pr4e.org/romeo.txt HTTP/1.0\n\n'.encode()
mysock.send(cmd)

while True:
    data = mysock.recv(512)
    if (len(data) < 1) :
        break
    print(data.decode())
mysock.close()
```

- `cmd = 'GET http://data.pr4e.org/romeo.txt HTTP/1.0\n\n'.encode()` will be BYTES.
- Then we send the bytes out with `mysock.send(cmd)`

# Classes
```python
class PartyAnimal:

    def __init__(self):  # method to initialize
        self.x = 0       # attribute x

    def party(self):     # method to 
        self.x = self.x + 1
        print("So far",self.x)

an = PartyAnimal()  # construct PartyAnimal store it in "an"

an.party()  # calling the party method on "an"
an.party()  # == PartyAnimal.party(an)
an.party()
```
- When the object is constructed, a specially named method is called to allocate and initialize attributes.
