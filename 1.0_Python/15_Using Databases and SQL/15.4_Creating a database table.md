#Databases 

- Databases require a more defined structure than Python lists or dictionaries.
- When we create a database *table* we must tell the db in advance the names of the *columns* in the table and the type of data which we are planning to store in each *column*.
- When the db software knows the type of data in each column, it can choose the most efficient way to store and look up the data based on the type of the data.

Defining structure for your data up front may seem inconvenient at first, but the payoff is fast access to your data even when the database contains a large amount of data.

The code to create a database Ô¨Åle and a table named Tracks with two columns in the database is as follows:
```python
import sqlite3
conn = sqlite3.connect('music.sqlite')
cur = conn.cursor()

cur.execute('DROP TABLE IF EXISTS Tracks')
cur.execute('CREATE TABLE Tracks (title TEXT, plays INTEGER)')

conn.close()
```

- The `connect` operation makes a "connection" to the database stored in the file `music.sqlite` in the current directory.
- If the file doesn't exist, it will be created.
- The reason it's called a connection is that sometimes the db is stored on a separate "database server" from the server on which we are running our application.
- In our examples the database will just be a local file in the same directory as the Python code we are running.
- A *cursor* is like a file handle that we can use to perform operations on the data stored in the database.
	- Calling `cursor()` is very similar conceptually to calling `open()` when dealing with text files.
- Once we have the cursor, we can begin to execute commands on the contents of the database using the `execute()` method.

Database commands are expressed in a standardized language called *Structured Query Language* or SQL for short.
- In our example, we execute two SQL commands in our db
- We will show the SQL keywords in uppercase and the parts of the command that we are adding (such as the table and column names) will be in lowercase.
- The first SQL command removes the `Tracks` table from the db if it exists.
- This allows us to create the same db table over and over without throwing an error.
- Note that the `DROP TABLE` command deletes the table and all of its contents from the db.
```python
cur.execute('DROP TABLE IF EXISTS Tracks ')
```

- The second command creates a table named `Tracks` with a column named `title` and an integer column named `plays`
```python
cur.execute('CREATE TABLE Tracks (title TEXT, plays INTEGER)')
```

- Now that we have created a table named `Tracks`, we can put some data into that table using the SQL `INSERT` operation.
	- Again, we begin by making a connection to the db and obtaining the `cursor`
	- We can then execute SQL commands using the cursor.

The SQL `INSERT` command indicates which table we are using and then defines a new row by listing the fields we want to include (title, plays) followed by `VALUES` we want placed in the new row.
- We specify the values as question marks (?, ?) to indicate that the actual values are passed in as a tuple ( 'My Way', 15) as the second parameter to the `execute()` call.
```python
import sqlite3

conn = sqlite3.connect('music.sqlite')
cur = conn.cursor()

cur.execute('INSERT INTO Tracks (title, plays) VALUES (?, ?)',
('Thunderstruck', 20))
cur.execute('INSERT INTO Tracks (title, plays) VALUES (?, ?)',
('My Way', 15))
conn.commit()

print('Tracks:')
cur.execute('SELECT title, plays FROM Tracks')
for row in cur:
    print(row)

cur.execute('DELETE FROM Tracks WHERE plays < 100')
conn.commit()

cur.close()
```
`Out:`
```python
Tracks:
('Thunderstruck', 20)
('My Way', 15)
```
- First we `INSERT` two rows into our table and use `commit()` to force the data to be written to the db file.
- Then we use the `SELECT` command to retrieve the rows we just inserted from the table.
	- On the `SELECT` command, we indicate which columns we would like(title, plays) and indicate which table we want to retrieve the data from.
- After we execute the `SELECT` statement, the cursor is something we can loop through in a `for` statement.

- For efficiency, the cursor doesn't read all of the data from the db when we execute the `SELECT` statement.
- Instead, the data is read on demand as we loop through the rows in the `for` statement.

Our for loop finds two rows, and each row is a Python tuple with the first value as the title and the second value as the number of plays.
- At the very end of the program, we execute the `DELETE` command to delete the rows we have just created so we can run the program over and over.
- Theres also a `WHERE` clause that allows us to express a selection criterion so that we can ask the database to apply the command to only the rows that match our criterion.

# BreakDown
Structured Data vs. Unstructured Data:

- Databases are designed to store data in a structured format. This means the data is organized into tables with predefined columns, ensuring consistency and allowing for efficient retrieval.
- In contrast, Python lists and dictionaries are more flexible data structures but lack the rigid structure of databases. While they can hold various data types, searching and manipulating large amounts of data can become cumbersome.
**Tables, Columns, and Data Types:**

- A database table is like a spreadsheet where each row represents a record (data point), and each column represents a specific attribute (field) of that data.
- When creating a table, you define the column names and their data types. Specifying data types (e.g., text, integer) allows the database to optimize storage and retrieval based on the data type.
Benefits of Defining Structure:

While defining structure upfront might seem restrictive, it offers significant advantages:
Faster Data Access: The database can efficiently locate and retrieve specific data based on its type and organization.
Data Integrity: Defining data types helps maintain consistency and prevents errors during data entry.
Connecting to a Database and Using a Cursor:

The code snippet demonstrates how to connect to a database file (music.sqlite) using the sqlite3 library in Python.
A cursor acts as an intermediary between your program and the database, allowing you to execute commands and manipulate data.
SQL (Structured Query Language):

SQL is a standardized language used to interact with relational databases. It provides commands for creating tables, inserting data, retrieving data, and updating/deleting data.
The code shows examples of DROP TABLE, CREATE TABLE, INSERT, SELECT, and DELETE commands in SQL.
Inserting Data:

The INSERT statement allows you to add new rows to a table. You specify the table name, columns to insert into, and the values for each column using placeholders (?) and a separate tuple containing the actual values.
Selecting Data:

The SELECT statement is used to retrieve data from a table. You can specify which columns to retrieve and optionally add a WHERE clause to filter the results based on certain conditions.
Fetching and Looping Through Results:

The cursor object returned by execute holds the retrieved data. You can access this data by looping through it in a for loop. Each row returned by the cursor is typically a tuple containing the values from each column.
Database Modifications (Updating and Deleting):

The code showcases using DELETE with a WHERE clause to delete rows from the table based on a specific condition (plays less than 100).
Similar to DELETE, UPDATE allows modifying existing data within the database.
Committing Changes:

The commit() method ensures that the changes you made to the database (inserts, deletes, updates) are written permanently to the database file.
Key Takeaways:

Databases provide a structured way to store and manage large amounts of data efficiently.
Defining data structure upfront is crucial for efficient data retrieval and manipulation.
SQL is a powerful language for interacting with relational databases.
Python libraries like sqlite3 make it easy to connect to and work with databases from your Python programs.
