#Databases 
- A *database* is a file that is organized for storing data.  

- Most databases are organized like a dictionary in the sense that they map from keys to values.
	- The biggest difference is that the database is on disk (permanent storage), so it persists after the program ends.
	- Because a db is stored on permanent storage, it can store far more data than a dictionary, which is limited to the size of the memory of the computer.


Like a dictionary, database software is designed to keep the inserting and accessing of data very fast, even for large amounts of data.
- Db software maintains its performance by building *indexes* as data is added to the db to allow the comp to jump quickly to a particular entry.
