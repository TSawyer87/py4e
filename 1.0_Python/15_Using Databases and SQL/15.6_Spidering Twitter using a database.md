This spidering program will go through Twitter accounts and build a database of them.
- Be very careful when running this program!
- Your account will get shut down if you pull too much data or run the program for too long.

A problem that spidering programs face is that it needs to be able to be stopped and restarted many times without losing data that has been retrieved so far.
- To prevent having to start over at the beginning every time we will store the data as the program runs so we can pick up where it left off w/o loss of data.
We will start by retrieving one person’s Twitter friends and their statuses, looping
through the list of friends, and adding each of the friends to a database to be
retrieved in the future. After we process one person’s Twitter friends, we check
in our database and retrieve one of the friends of the friend. We do this over and
over, picking an “unvisited” person, retrieving their friend list, and adding friends
we have not seen to our list for a future visit.
We also track how many times we have seen a particular friend in the database to
get some sense of their “popularity”.
By storing our list of known accounts and whether we have retrieved the account
or not, and how popular the account is in a database on the disk of the computer,
we can stop and restart our program as many times as we like.
This program is a bit complex. It is based on the code from the exercise earlier in
the book that uses the Twitter API.
Here is the source code for our Twitter spidering application:
```python
from urllib.request import urlopen
import urllib.error
import twurl
import json
import sqlite3
import ssl

TWITTER_URL = 'https://api.twitter.com/1.1/friends/list.json'

conn = sqlite3.connect('spider.sqlite')
cur = conn.cursor()

cur.execute('''
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS Twitter
(name TEXT, retrieved INTEGER, friends INTEGER)''')

# Ignore SSL certificate errors
ctx = ssl.create_default_context()
ctx.check_hostname = False
ctx.verify_mode = ssl.CERT_NONE

while True:
    acct = input('Enter a Twitter account, or quit: ')
    if (acct == 'quit'):
        break
    if (len(acct) < 1):
        cur.execute('SELECT name FROM Twitter WHERE retrieved = 0 LIMIT 1')
        try:
            acct = cur.fetchone()[0]
        except:
            print('No unretrieved Twitter accounts found')
            continue

    url = twurl.augment(TWITTER_URL, {'screen_name': acct, 'count': '20'})
    print('Retrieving', url)
    connection = urlopen(url, context=ctx)
    data = connection.read().decode()
    headers = dict(connection.getheaders())

    print('Remaining', headers['x-rate-limit-remaining'])
    js = json.loads(data)
    # Debugging
    # print json.dumps(js, indent=4)

    cur.execute('UPDATE Twitter SET retrieved=1 WHERE name = ?', (acct, ))

    countnew = 0
    countold = 0
    for u in js['users']:
        friend = u['screen_name']
        print(friend)
        cur.execute(
            'SELECT friends FROM Twitter WHERE name = ? LIMIT 1', (friend, ))
        try:
            count = cur.fetchone()[0]
            cur.execute(
                'UPDATE Twitter SET friends = ? WHERE name = ?', (count+1, friend))
            countold = countold + 1
        except:
            cur.execute(
                '''INSERT INTO Twitter (name, retrieved, friends) VALUES (?, 0, 1)''', (friend, ))
            countnew = countnew + 1
    print('New accounts=', countnew, ' revisited=', countold)
    conn.commit()

cur.close()
```

- Our database is stored in the file `spider.sqlite` and it has one table named `Twitter`.
- Each row in the `Twitter` table has a column for the account name, 
- whether we have retrieved the friends of this account,
- and how many times this account has been "friended".

We prompt the user for a Twitter account name or "quit" to exit the program.
- If the user enters a Twitter account, we retrieve the list of friends and statuses for that user and add each friend to the db if not already in the db.
- If the friend is already in the list, we add 1 to the `friends` field in the row in the db.

If the user presses enter, we look in the db for the next Twitter account that is yet to be retrieved, retrieve the friends and statuses for that account,
- add them to the db or update them, & increase their `friends` count.

- Once we retrieve the list of friends and statuses, we loop through all of the user items in the returned JSON and retrieve the screen_name for each user. 
- Then we use the SELECT statement to see if we already have stored this particular screen_name in the database and retrieve the friend count (friends) if the record exists.
```python
    countnew = 0
    countold = 0
    for u in js['users']:
        friend = u['screen_name']
        print(friend)
        cur.execute(
            'SELECT friends FROM Twitter WHERE name = ? LIMIT 1', (friend, ))
        try:
            count = cur.fetchone()[0]
            cur.execute(
                'UPDATE Twitter SET friends = ? WHERE name = ?', (count+1, friend))
            countold = countold + 1
        except:
            cur.execute(
                '''INSERT INTO Twitter (name, retrieved, friends) VALUES (?, 0, 1)''', (friend, ))
            countnew = countnew + 1
    print('New accounts=', countnew, ' revisited=', countold)
    conn.commit()

cur.close()
```

Once the cursor executes the `SELECT` statement, we must retrieve the rows.
- We could do this with a `for` statement, but since we are only retrieving one row (LIMIT 1), we can use the `fetchone()` method to fetch only the first row that is the result of the `SELECT` operation.
- Since `fetchone()` returns the row as a *tuple* (even though there is only one field), we take the first value from the tuple using to get the current friend count into the variable `count`.

If this retrieval is successful, we use the SQL `UPDATE` statement with a `WHERE` clause to add 1 to the `friends` column for the fow that matches the friend's account.
	- There are 2 placeholders (the ? marks) in SQL, and the second parameter to the `execute()` is a two-element tuple that holds the values to be substituted into the SQL in pace of the ? marks.
- If the code in the try block fails, it is probably because no record matched the `WHERE name = ?` clause on the `SELECT` statement.
- So in the `except` block, we use the SQL `INSERT` statement to add the friend's `screen_name` & set the friend count to one.

So the first time the program runs and we enter a Twitter account, the program runs as follows:
```bash
Enter a Twitter account, or quit: drchuck
Retrieving http://api.twitter.com/1.1/friends ...
New accounts= 20 revisited= 0
Enter a Twitter account, or quit: quit
```
- Since this is the first time we run the program, the db is empty and we create the db in the file `spider.sqlite` and add a table named `Twitter` to the db.
- Then we retrieve some friends and add them all to the db.

At this point we might want to write a simple db dumper to take a look at what is in our `spider.sqlite` file:
```python
import sqlite3

conn = sqlite3.connect('spider.sqlite')
cur = conn.cursor()
cur.execute('SELECT * FROM Twitter')
count = 0
for row in cur:
    print(row)
    count = count + 1
print(count, 'rows.')
cur.close()

# twdump.py
```
- This simply opens the db & selects all of the columns of all of the rows in the table `Twitter`,
- then loops through the rows and prints each row.

If we run this program after the first execution of our Twitter spider above, its output will be:
```python
('opencontent', 0, 1)
('lhawthorn', 0, 1)
('steve_coppin', 0, 1)
('davidkocher', 0, 1)
('hrheingold', 0, 1)
...
20 rows.
```
- We see one row for each `screen_name`, that we haven't retrieved the data for that `screen_name`,
- and everyone in the db has one friend.

Now that our db reflects the retrieval of the friends of drchuck.
- we can run the program again & tell it to retrieve the friends of the next "unprocessed" account by simply pressing enter instead of a Twitter acct as follows:
```python
Enter a Twitter account, or quit:
Retrieving http://api.twitter.com/1.1/friends ...
New accounts= 18 revisited= 2
Enter a Twitter account, or quit:
Retrieving http://api.twitter.com/1.1/friends ...
New accounts= 17 revisited= 3
Enter a Twitter account, or quit: quit
```

Since we pressed enter the following code is executed:
```python
if ( len(acct) < 1 ) : 
    cur.execute('SELECT name FROM Twitter WHERE retrieved = 0 LIMIT 1')
    try: acct = cur.fetchone()[0]
    except:
        print('No unretrieved twitter accounts found')
        continue
```

- We use the SQL SELECT statement to retrieve the name of the first (LIMIT 1) user who still has their “have we retrieved this user” value set to zero.

- We also use the `fetchone()[0]` pattern within a try/except block to either extract a `screen_name` from the retrieved data or put out an error message and loop back up.

If we successfully retrieved an unprocessed `screen_name`, we retrieve their data as follows:
```python
url=twurl.augment(TWITTER_URL,{'screen_name': acct,'count': '20'})
print('Retrieving', url)
data = connection.read()
js = json.loads(data)

cur.execute('UPDATE Twitter SET retrieved=1 WHERE name = ?',(acct, ))
```
