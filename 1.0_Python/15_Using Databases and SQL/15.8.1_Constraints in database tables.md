#Databases 
As we design our table structures, we can tell the db system that we want to enforce a few rules on us.
- These rules help keep us from making mistakes & introducing incorrect data into our tables. 
When we create our tables:
```python
cur.execute('''CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS People
    (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT UNIQUE, retrieved INTEGER)''')
cur.execute('''CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS Follows
    (from_id INTEGER, to_id INTEGER, UNIQUE(from_id, to_id)''')
```
- We indicate that the `name` column in the `People` table must be `UNIQUE`. 
- Also that the combination of the two numbers in each row of the `Follows` table must be unique.
- These constraints keep us from making mistakes such as adding the same relationship more than once.

We can take advantage of the constraints like this:
```python
cur.execute('''INSERT OR IGNORE INTO People (name, retrieved) VALUES (?, 0)''', (friend, ))
```
Again, we simply tell the database to ignore our attempted INSERT if it would
violate the uniqueness constraint that we specified for the Follows rows.-*
