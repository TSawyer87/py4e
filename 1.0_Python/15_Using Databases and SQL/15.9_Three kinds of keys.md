#Databases 

There are generally three kinds of keys used in a database model.
- A *logical key* is a key that the "real world" might use to look up a row.
	- In our example the `name` field is the logical key.
	- It often makes sence to add a `UNIQUE` constraint to a logical key.
	- Since the logical key is how we look up a row from the outside world, it makes little sense to allow multiple rows with the same value in the table.

-A *primary key* is usually a number that is assigned automatically by the database.
	- It generally has no meaning outside the program and is only used to link rows from different tables together.
	- The primary key is usually the fastest way to look up a row in a table.
	- Since primary keys are integers, they take up very little storage and can be compared or sorted very quickly.
	- In our example the `id` field is the primary key.

- A *foreign key* is usually a number that points to the primary key of an associated row in a different table.
- A foreign key in our example was the `from_id`.
