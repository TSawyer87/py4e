#Databases 
The primary data structures in a database are: *tables, rows*, and *columns.*
- In technical descriptions of relational databases the concepts of table, row, and column are called a *relation, tuple*, and *attribute*.

- **Database** : contains many tables
- **Relation** (or table) : contains tuples and attributes. A relation is defined as a set of tuples that have attributes.
- **Tuple** (or row) - a set of fields that generally represents an "object" like a person or a music track.
- **Attribute** (or column): one of possibly many elements of data corresponding to the object represented by the row.
