#Files 

When searching though data in a file, it's common to read through the file, ignoring most of it and only processing lines that meet a certain condition.
- We combine the pattern for reading a file with string methods to build simple search mechanisms.

If we wanted to read a file and only print the lines that start with the prefix "From: ", we could use the string method *startswith* to select only the lines with the desired prefix:
```python
fhand = open('mbox-short.txt')
count = 0
for line in fhand:
    if line.startswith('From:'):
        print(line)
        
```
Out:
```python
From: stephen.marquard@uct.ac.za

From: louis@media.berkeley.edu

From: zqian@umich.edu

From: rjlowe@iupui.edu
...
```

We see the extra blank lines between the text because of the newline character.
- Each of the lines ends with a newline, so the **print** statement prints the string in the variable *line* which includes a newline.
- Then **print** adds *another* newline, resulting in the double spacing we see.

We could use line slicing to print all but the last character, but a simpler approach is to use the rstrip method which strips whitespace from the right side of a string
As follows:
```python
fhand = open('mbox-short.txt')
for line in fhand:
    line = line.rstrip()
    if line.startswith('From:'):
        print(line) 
```
Out:
```python
From: stephen.marquard@uct.ac.za
From: louis@media.berkeley.edu
From: zqian@umich.edu
From: rjlowe@iupui.edu
...
```

As your file processing programs get more complicated, you may want to structure your search loops using **continue**. 

The basic idea of the search loop is that you are
Looking for “interesting” lines and effectively skipping “uninteresting” lines. And then when we find an interesting line, we do something with that line.

We can structure the loop to follow the pattern of skipping uninteresting lines as follows:
```python
fhand = open('mbox-short.txt')
for line in fhand:
    line = line.rstrip()
    # Skip 'uninteresting lines'
    if not line.startswith('From:'):
        continue
    # Process our 'interesting' line
    print(line)
```

- The output of the program is the same. In English, the uninteresting lines are those which do not start with “From:”, which we skip using continue. For the
“interesting” lines (i.e., those that start with “From:”) we perform the processing on those lines.

You can use the **fine** string method to simulate a text editor search that finds lines where the search string is anywhere in the line.
-  **find** looks for an occurrence of a string within another string.
- Then either returns the position of the string or -1 if the string wasn't found.

The following loop shows lines containing ("@uct. Ac. Za"):
```python
fhand = open('mbox-short.txt')
for line in fhand:
    line = line.rstrip()
    if line.find('@uct.ac.za') == -1 : continue
    print(line)
```
Out:
```python

Recommended to use with open:
```python
with open('mbox-short.txt') as fhand:
    for line in fhand:
        line = line.rstrip()
        if line.find('@uct.ac.za') == -1: continue
        print(line)
```

Here's why using `with open` is generally recommended even if you don't explicitly store the handle:

- **Guaranteed Closure:** Regardless of exceptions or errors within the code block, the `with open` statement guarantees the file will be closed using a context manager. This prevents potential file handle leaks or resource management issues.
- **Improved Readability:** The `with open` statement makes the code cleaner and indicates the scope within which the file is open. It's a more explicit way of handling file I/O.
