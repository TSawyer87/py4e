#Files 

A text file can be thought of as a sequence of lines, much like a Python string can be thought of as a sequence of characters.

For example, this is a sample of a text
File which records mail activity from various individuals in an open source project development team:
```python
From stephen.marquard@uct.ac.za Sat Jan 5 09:14:16 2008
Return-Path: <postmaster@collab.sakaiproject.org>
Date: Sat, 5 Jan 2008 09:12:18 -0500
To: source@collab.sakaiproject.org
From: stephen.marquard@uct.ac.za
Subject: [sakai] svn commit: r39772 - content/branches/
Details: http://source.sakaiproject.org/viewsvn/?view=rev&rev=39772
...
```

The entire file is "mbox. Txt" and the shortened version is "mbox-short. Txt".
- These files are in a standard format for a file containing multiple mail messages.
- The lines which start with "From" separate the messages and the lines which start with "From: " are part of the messages.

To break a file into lines there is a special "end of line" character the *newline* character. Which is a backslash-n in string constants. \n .

 When we look at the variable by entering “stuff” in the interpreter, it shows us the \n In the string, but when we use print to show the string, we see the string broken
Into two lines by the newline character.
```python
>>> stuff = 'Hello\nWorld!'
>>> stuff
'Hello\nWorld!'
>>> print(stuff)
Hello
World!
>>> stuff = 'X\nY'
>>> print(stuff)
X
Y
>>> len(stuff)
3
```
- See that len (stuff) is only 3 because the newline character is a single character.
- So when we look at the lines in a file, we need to *imagine* the newline character at the end of each line that marks the end of the line.
- So the newline character separates the characters in the file into lines.
