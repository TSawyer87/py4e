#Files
![[7_Files]]

When you open a file, you are asking the o.s. to find the file by name and make sure the file exists.

To open a file you must be in the same directory (folder) that the file is located in.
```python
>>> fhand = open('mbox.txt')
>>> print(fhand)
>>> <_io.TextIOWrapper name='mbox.txt' mode='r' encoding='UTF-8'>
```
- If the **open** is successful, the o.s. returns a *file handle*.
- The file handle is not the actual data contained in the file, it is a "handle" that we can use to read the data.
- You are given a handle if the requested file exists and you have the proper permissions to read the file.

If the file doesn't exist, open will fail with a traceback and you will not get a handle to access the contents of the file:
```python
>>> fhand = open('stuff.txt')
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'stuff.txt'
```
- You can use **try** and **except** to deal with this situation more gracefully.
