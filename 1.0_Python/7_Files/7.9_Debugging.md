#Debugging 

When you are reading and writing files, you might run into problems with whitespace. These errors can be hard to debug because spaces, tabs, and newlines are
Normally invisible:
```python
>>> s = '1 2\t 3\n 4'
>>> print(s)
1 2  3
 4
```
- The built-in function **repr** can help. It takes any object as an argument and returns a string representation of the object.
- For strings, it represents whitespace characters with backslash sequences:
```python
>>> print(repr(s))
'1 2\t 3\n 4'
```
- This can be helpful for debugging.
- Another problem that you may come across is that different systems use different characters for newlines.
- For most systems, there are apps to convert from one format to another.
