#Files 

To ask user to input the filename each time they run the program allowing them to use it on other files without changing the Python code:
```python
fname = input('Enter the file name: ')
fhand = open(fname)
count = 0
for line in fhand:
    if line.startswith('Subject:'):
        count = count + 1
print('There were', count, 'subject lines in', fname)
```

```python
Enter the file name: mbox.txt
There were 1797 subject lines in mbox.txt

Enter the file name: mbox-short.txt
There were 27 subject lines in mbox-short.txt

```

Try and Except Block added:
```python
fname = input('Enter the file name: ')

try:
    with open(fname) as fhand:  # Open the file using 'with open' for 
        count = 0               # guaranteed closure
        for line in fhand:
            if line.startswith('Subject:'):
                count += 1  # Use += for concise counter increment
        print('There were', count, 'subject lines in', fname)

except FileNotFoundError:  # Catch specific exception for clarity
    print('Error: File does not exist.')

```

Here's a breakdown of the improvements:

    with open Statement: This ensures the file is properly closed even if an exception occurs within the try block.
    Specific Exception Handling: The except block now catches the FileNotFoundError specifically, providing a more informative error message.
    Concise Counter Increment: The count += 1 syntax is a shorthand for incrementing the count variable.

How it Works:

    User Input: The code prompts the user for a file name and stores it in the fname variable.
    try Block:
        It attempts to open the file using with open(fname).
        If the file opens successfully, the code inside the with block executes:
            A count variable is initialized to 0 to keep track of subject lines.
            A for loop iterates over each line in the open file (fhand).
            Inside the loop:
                The if statement checks if the line starts with "Subject:".
                If it does, count is incremented by 1.
            After the loop, the code prints a message indicating the number of subject lines found in the file.
    except FileNotFoundError:
        If the file is not found, this except block catches the specific FileNotFoundError exception.
        It prints a more informative error message to the user, letting them know the file doesn't exist.

Additional Considerations:

    You could consider adding more except blocks to handle other potential exceptions, such as permission errors or invalid file formats.
    For more complex error handling scenarios, you might explore exception hierarchies and custom exception classes.

By incorporating these improvements, the code becomes more robust, provides better feedback to the user, and adheres to recommended practices for file handling in Python.
