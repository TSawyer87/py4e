If you are in an iteration of a loop and want to finish the current iteration & jump to the next iteration you can use the **continue** statement to skip to the next iteration without finishing the body of the loop for the current iteration.

Here is a loop that copies input until the user types "done", but treats lines that start with (#) as lines not to be printed:
```
while True:
    line = input('> ')
    if line[0] == '#':
        continue
    if line == 'done':
        break
    print(line)

print('Done!')
> hello there
hello there
> # don't print this
> print this!
print this!
> done
Done!
```

All the lines are printed except the one that starts with the hash sign because when the continue is executed, it ends the current iteration and jumps back to the while statement to start the next iteration, thus skipping the print statement.
