#Variables 
A common pattern in assignment statements is an assignment statement that updates a variable, where the new value of the variable depends on the old.:
```python
x = x + 1  # get the current value of x, add 1,
           # & update x with new value
```

If you try to update a variable that doesn't exist, you get an error, because Python evaluates the right side before it assigns a value to x:
```python
>>> x = x + 1
NameError: name 'x' is not defined
```

 Before you can update a variable, you have to *initialize* it, usually with a simple assignment: ( increment )
 ```python
 >>> x = 0       # Updating a var by adding 1 is     
 >>> x = x + 1   # called increment
 ```

(decrement)
```python
>>> x = 0      # Updating a var by subtracting 1 is
>>> x = x - 1  # called decrement
```
