Exercise 1: Write a program which repeatedly reads numbers until the user enters “done”. Once “done” is entered, print out the total, count, and average of the numbers. If the user enters anything other than a
number , detect their mistake using try and except and print an error message and skip to the next number.
```
total = 0
count = 0

while True:
    # Get user input
    user_input = input("Enter a number:(or 'done' to finish): ")

    # Check if user wants to quit
    if user_input.lower() == 'done':
        break

    # Try converting input to a number
    try:
        number = float(user_input)
        total += number
        count += 1
    except ValueError:
        # Handle non-numeric input
        print("Invalid input. Please enter a number.")

    # Calculate average (avoid division by zero)
    if count > 0:
        average = total / count
        print(f"Total: {total:.2f}")
        print(f"Count: {count}")
        print(f"Average: {average:.2f}")
    else:
        print("No numbers were entered.")
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:**
    
    - `total`: Stores the sum of all entered numbers (initialized to 0).
    - `count`: Keeps track of the number of numbers entered (initialized to 0).
2. **Loop:**
    
    - The `while True` loop continues until explicitly broken.
3. **User Input:**
    
    - `input` prompts the user to enter a number or "done".
4. **Exit Condition:**
    
    - If the user enters "done" (converted to lowercase for case-insensitivity), the loop breaks (`break`).
5. **Error Handling (try-except):**
    
    - The `try` block attempts to convert the user input to a float using `float(user_input)`.
    - If the conversion fails (non-numeric input), a `ValueError` exception is raised.
    - The `except ValueError` block handles the exception and prints an error message without crashing the program.
6. **Valid Input Processing:**
    
    - If no exception occurs (valid number), the code assigns the converted number to a variable `number`.
    - `total` is updated by adding the current number.
    - `count` is incremented to reflect the additional number.
7. **Average Calculation (if applicable):**
    
    - After the loop finishes, an `if` statement checks if `count` is greater than 0 (meaning at least one number was entered).
    - If there were numbers entered:
        - `average` is calculated by dividing the `total` by `count`.
        - The program then prints the `total`, `count`, and `average` with two decimal places using formatted string literals (f-strings).
    - If no numbers were entered (`count` is 0), it prints a message indicating that.

**Improvements:**

- **Error handling:** The code gracefully handles non-numeric input using a `try-except` block, providing a user-friendly error message.
- **Clarity:** Comments are added to explain specific code sections.
- **Formatted output:** F-strings are used for clean and readable output formatting.

This program effectively addresses user input validation, error handling, and conditional average calculation, making it robust and informative.
