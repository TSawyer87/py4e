#Loops

Because iteration is so common, Python provides several language features to make it easier.

One form of iteration is the **while** statement. 
Here is a simple program that counts down from five and then says "Blastoff!":
```
n = 5
while n > 0:
    print(n)
    n = n -1
print('Blastoff!')

5
4
3
2
1
Blastoff!
```
You can almost read the while statement as if it were English. It means, “While n is greater than 0, display the value of n and then reduce the value of n by 1. When you get to 0, exit the while statement and display the word Blastoff!”

Here is the flow of execution for a while statement:
1. Evaluate the condition, yielding **True** or **False**.
2. If the condition is false, exit the while statement and continue execution at the next statement.
3. If the condition is true, execute the body and then go back to step 1.
- This type of flow is called a *loop* because the third step loops back arount to the top.
- We call each time we execute the body of the loop an *iteration*. 
- The above loop had five iterations, the body was executed 5 times.

The body of the loop should change the value of one or more variables so that eventually the condition becomes false and the loop terminates. We call the variable that changes each time the loop executes and controls when the loop finishes
The iteration variable. If there is no iteration variable, the loop will repeat forever, resulting in an infinite loop.
