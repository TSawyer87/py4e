- It's easy to forget what parts of your program do with time so it is a good idea to add comments to remind yourself and others what the program is doing.

```
# compute the percentage of the hour that has elapsed
percentage = (minute * 100) / 60

percentage = (minute * 100) / 60    #percentage of an hour.
```

- Comments document non-obvious features of the code.
- Good variable names can reduce the need for comments, but long names make complex expressions hard to read, so there's the trade-off.
