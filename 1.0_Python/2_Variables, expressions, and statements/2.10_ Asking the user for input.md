- Sometimes we want to take the value for a variable from the user via their keyboard.
- The input () function gets input from the keyboard.
- When input () is called, the program'')
```python
>>> inp = input()  
Some silly stuff  
>>> print(inp)  
Some silly stuff

# prompt the user telling them what you're asking for.
>>> name = input('What is your name?\n')  
What is your name?  
Chuck  
>>> print(name)  
Chuck
```

- \n represents a *newline*, a special character that causes a line break. Thats why the user's input appears below the prompt.

If you expect the user to input an integer, you can try to convert the value to int usint the int () function:
```python
>>> prompt = 'What...is the airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow?\n'
>>> speed = input(prompt)
What...is the airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow?
17
>>> int(speed)
17
>>> int(speed) + 5
22
```

But if the user types something other than a string of digits, you get an error:
```python
>>> speed = input(prompt)  
What...is the airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow?  
What do you mean, an African or a European swallow?  
>>> int(speed)  
ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10:
