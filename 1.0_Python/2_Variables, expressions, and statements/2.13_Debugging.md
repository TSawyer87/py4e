#Debugging
- The runtime error you are most likely to make is a "use before def;" that is, trying to use a variable before you have assigned a value.
- This can happen if you spell a variable name wrong:
```python
>>>principal = 327.68
>>> interest = principle * rate
NameError: name 'principle' is not defined
```

-  The most likely cause of a semantic error is the order of operations at this point. 
- For example, to evaluate 1/2 pi, you might be tempted to write:
```python
>>> 1.0 / 2.0 * pi   # but division happens first, so you would get
>>>                  # pi/2, which is not the same thing!
```
