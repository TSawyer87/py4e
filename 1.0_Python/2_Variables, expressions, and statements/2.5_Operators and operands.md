- *Operators* are special symbols that represent computations like addition and multiplication.
- The values the operator is applied to are called *operands*.
 The operators +, -, *, /, and ** perform addition, subtraction, multiplication,
Division, and exponentiation, as in the following examples:

```python
20+32
hour-1
hour*60+minute
minute/60
5**2
(5+9)*(15-7)
```

There has been a change in the division operator between Python 2. X and Python
3.x. In Python 3. X, the result of this division is a floating point result:
```python
>>> minute = 59
>>> minute/60
0.9833333333333333
```

In Python 3 use floored (// integer) division.
```python
>>> minute = 59
>>> minute//60
0
```
