- An *expression* is a combination of values, variables, and operators.
- A value all by itself is considered an expression, also a variable, as well as the following are all legal expressions (as long as x has been assigned a value):
```python
17
x
x + 17
```

If you type an expression in interactive mode, the interpreter *evaluates* it and displays the result:
```python
>>> 1 + 1
2
```

But in a script, an expression all by itself doesn't do anything!
