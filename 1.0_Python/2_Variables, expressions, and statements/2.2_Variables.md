#Variables
- One of the most powerful features of a programming language is the ability to manipulate variables. 
- A variable is a name that refers to a value.
- An assignment statement creates new variables and gives them values:

```python
>>> message = 'And now for something completely different'
>>> n = 17
>>> pi = 3.141592653897931
>>> print(n)
17
>>>print(pi)
3.141592653589793
```

The type of a variable is the type of the value it refers to.

```python
>>> type(message)
<class 'str'>
>>> type(n)
<class 'int'>
>>> type(pi)
<class 'float'>
```
