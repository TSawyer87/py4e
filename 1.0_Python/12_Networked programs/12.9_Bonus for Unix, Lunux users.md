If you have a Linux, Unix, or Macintosh computer, you probably have commands built in to your operating system that retrieves both plain text and binary files using the HTTP or File Transfer (FTP) protocols. One of these commands is `curl`:
$ `curl -O http://www.py4e.com/cover.jpg`

`Out:`
```
% Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current
                                 Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed
100   167  100   167    0     0    800      0 --:--:-- --:--:-- --:--:--   802
```
- The command `curl` is short for "copy URL" 
- The examples from the code 3 zip named `curl1.py` and `curl2.py` implement similar functionality to the curl command.

	A second command that functions similarly is `wget`:
	$ `wget http://www.py4e.com/cover.jpg`

`Out:`
```
cover.jpg.1          100% [=============================>]   68.41K    --.-KB/s
[Files: 1  Bytes: 68.57K [115.4]
```
- Both of these commands make retrieving webpages and remote files a simple task.
