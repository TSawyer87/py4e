#HTML #Regex 
- One simple way to parse HTML is to use regular expressions to repeatedly search for and extract substrings that match a particular pattern.
Here is a simple web page:
```html
<h1>The First Page</h1>
<p>
If you like, you can switch to the 
<a href="http://www.dr-chuck.com/page2.htm">
Second Page</a>
</p>
```
- We can construct a well-formed regex to match and extract the link values from the above text as follows:
```html
href="http[s]?://.+?"
```
- Our regex looks for strings that start with "href="http://" or "href="https://", 
- Followed by one or more characters `(.+?)`,
- Followed by another double quote.
- The question mark behind the `[s]?` indicates to search for the string "http" followed by zero or one "s".
The question mark added to the .+? Indicates that the match is to be done in a “non-greedy” fashion instead of a “greedy” fashion. A non-greedy match tries
To find the smallest possible matching string and a greedy match tries to find the largest possible matching string.

We add parentheses to our regular expression to indicate which part of our matched string we would like to extract, and produce the following program:
```python
# Search for link values within URL input
import urllib.request, urllib.parse, urllib.error
import re
import ssl

# Ignore SSL certificate errors
ctx = ssl.create_default_context()
ctx.check_hostname = False
ctx.verify_mode = ssl.CERT_NONE

url = input('Enter - ')
html = urllib.request.urlopen(url, context=ctx).read()
links = re.findall(b'href="(http[s]?://.*?)"', html)
for link in links:
    print(link.decode())
```
