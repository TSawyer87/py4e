#HTML #Regex 
- One simple way to parse HTML is to use regular expressions to repeatedly search for and extract substrings that match a particular pattern.
Here is a simple web page:
```html
<h1>The First Page</h1>
<p>
If you like, you can switch to the 
<a href="http://www.dr-chuck.com/page2.htm">
Second Page</a>
</p>
```
- We can construct a well-formed regex to match and extract the link values from the above text as follows:
```html
href="http[s]?://.+?"
```
- Our regex looks for strings that start with "href="http://" or "href="https://", 
- Followed by one or more characters `(.+?)`,
- Followed by another double quote.
- The question mark behind the `[s]?` indicates to search for the string "http" followed by zero or one "s".
The question mark added to the .+? Indicates that the match is to be done in a “non-greedy” fashion instead of a “greedy” fashion. A non-greedy match tries
To find the smallest possible matching string and a greedy match tries to find the largest possible matching string.

We add parentheses to our regular expression to indicate which part of our matched string we would like to extract, and produce the following program:
```python
# Search for link values within URL input
import urllib.request, urllib.parse, urllib.error
import re
import ssl

# Ignore SSL certificate errors
ctx = ssl.create_default_context()
ctx.check_hostname = False
ctx.verify_mode = ssl.CERT_NONE

url = input('Enter - ')
html = urllib.request.urlopen(url, context=ctx).read()
links = re.findall(b'href="(http[s]?://.*?)"', html)
for link in links:
    print(link.decode())
```

- The `ssl` library allows this program to access web sites that strictly enforse HTTPS.
- The `read` method returns HTML source code as a bytes object instead of returning an HTTP Response object.
- The `findall` regex method will give us a list of all of the strings that match our regex, returning only the link text between the double quotes.

When we run the program and input a URL, we get this output:

- Regular expressions work very nicely when your HTML is well formatted and predictable.
- But since there are a lot of "broken" HTML pages out there, a solution only using regex might either miss some valid links or end up with bad data.
- This can be solved using a robust HTML parsing library. (BeautifulSoup)
