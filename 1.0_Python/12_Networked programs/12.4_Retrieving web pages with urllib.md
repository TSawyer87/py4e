- While you can manually send and receive data over HTTP using the socket library, there is a much simpler way using the **urllib** library.
- Using **urllib**, you can treat a web page much like a file.
- You simply indicate which web page you would like to retrieve and **urllib** handles all of the HTTP protocol and header details.

The equivalent code to read the `romeo.txt` file from the web using **urllib** is as follows:
```python
import urllib.request

fhand = urllib.request.urlopen('http://data.pr4e.org/romeo.txt')
for line in fhand:
    print(line.decode().strip())
```
- Once the web page has been opened with `urllib.urlopen`, you can treat it like a file and read through it using a **for** loop.

When the program runs, we only see the output of the contents of the file.
- The **urllib** code consumes the headers and only returns the data to us.
```
But soft what light through yonder window breaks
It is the east and Juliet is the sun
Arise fair sun and kill the envious moon
Who is already sick and pale with grief
```

We can write a program to retrieve the data for `romeo.txt` and compute the frequency of each word in the file like this:
```python 3
import urllib.request, urllib.parse, urllib.error

fhand = urllib.request.urlopen('http://data.pr4e.org/romeo.txt')
counts = dict()
for line in fhand:
    words = line.decode().split()
    for word in words:
        counts[word] = counts.get(word, 0) + 1
print(counts)
```
