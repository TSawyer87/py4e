#Dictionaries #Tuples 

> [!items method]
> Dictionaries have a method called **items** that returns a list of tuples, where each tuple is a key-value pair:
> ```python
> d = {'a':10, 'b':1, 'c':22}
> t = list(d.items())
> print(t)
> ```
> `Out:`
> ```python
> [('b', 1), ('a', 10), ('c', 22)]
> ```

- The items are in no particular order as usual with dictionaries but it doesn't matter because of the key-value pairs.
- Since the list of tuples is a list, and tuples are comparable, we can now sort the list of tuples.
- Converting a dictionary to a list of tuples is a way for us to output the contents of a dictionary sorted by key:
```python
d = {'a':10, 'b':1, 'c':22}
t = list(d.items())
t
t.sort()
t
```
`Out:`
```python
[('b', 1), ('a', 10), ('c', 22)]  # before sort

[('a', 10), ('b', 1), ('c', 22)]  # after sort
```
-  The new list is sorted in ascending alphabetical order by key value.
