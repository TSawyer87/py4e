#Dictionaries #Tuples 

We can augment our program to use a technique to print the ten most common words in *Romeo and Juliet*:
```python
import string
fhand = open('romeo-full.txt')
counts = dict()
for line in fhand:
    line = line.translate(str.maketrans('','', string.punctuation))
    line = line.lower()
    words = line.split()
    for word in words:
        if word not in counts:
            counts[word] = 1
        else:
            counts[word] += 1

# Sort the dictionary by value
lst = list()
for key, val in list(counts.items()):
    lst.append((val, key))

lst.sort(reverse=True)

for key, val in lst[:10]:
    print(key, val)
```
`Out:`
```python
61 i
42 and
40 romeo
34 to
34 the
32 thou
32 juliet
30 that
29 my
24 thee
```

- The first part of the program which reads the file and computes the dictionary that maps each word to the count of words in the doc is unchanged.
- Then we construct a list of (val, key) tuples 
- Then sort the list in reversed order.

- Since the value is first, it will be used for comparisons.
- If there is more than one tuple with the same value, it will look at the second element (the key)
- So tuples where the value is the same will be further sorted by the alphabetical order of the key.
- At the end we write a **for** loop which does multiple assignment iteration and prints out the ten most common words by iterating through a slice of the list (lst[:10])
- The fact that this complex data parsing and analysis can be done with an easy-to-understand 19-line Py program is one reason why Py is a good lang for exploring info.
