#Tuples 

One of the unique syntactic features of Python is the ability to have a tuple on the left side of an assignment statement statement.
- This allows you to assign more than one variable at a time when the left side is a sequence.

- In this example we have a two-element list (which is a sequence) and assign the first and second elements of the sequence to the variables x any y in a single statement:
```python
m = ['have', 'fun']
x, y = m
x
'have'
y
'fun'
```
- It's not magic, Python *roughly* translates the tuple assignment syntax to be the following:
```python
m = ['have', 'fun']
x = m[0]
y = m[1]
x
'have'
y
'fun'
```

- Stylistically when we use a tuple on the left side of the assignment statement, we omit the parentheses, but this is valid as well:
```python
m = ['have', 'fun']
(x, y) = m
x
'have'
y
'fun'

```

- A particularly clever application of tuple assignment allows us to *swap* the values of two variables in a single statement:
```python
a, b = b, a  
```
-  both sides are tuples, the left a tuple of variables, on the right a tuple of expressions.
- Each value on the right side is assigned to its respective variable on the left side.
- All expressions on the right side are evaluated before any of the assignments.
- The number of variables on the left and the number of values on the right must be the same
```python
a, b = 1, 2, 3
ValueError: too many values to unpack
```

- More generally, the right side can be any kind of sequence (string, list, or tuple).
- To split an email address into a user name and domain:
```python
addr = 'monty@python.org'
uname, domain = addr.split('@')
```
`Out:`
```python
print(uname)
monty
print(domain)
python.org
```
