#Tuples #Dictionaries 

- Because tuples are *hashable* and lists are not, if we want to create a *composite* key to use in a dictionary we must use a tuple as the key.
- We would encounter a composite key if we wanted to create a telephone directory that maps from last-name, first-name pairs to telephone numbers.
- Assuming that we have defined the variables **last, first, and number**, we could write a dict assignment statement like this:
```python
directory[last,first] = number
```
- The expression in brackets is a tuple.
- We could use tuple assignment in a **for** loop to traverse this dictionary.
```python
for last, first in dictionary:
    print(first, last, directory[last,first])
```
- This loop traverses the keys in `directory`, which are tuples.
- It assigns the elements of each tuple to `last` and `first`
- Then prints the name and corresponding telephone number.
