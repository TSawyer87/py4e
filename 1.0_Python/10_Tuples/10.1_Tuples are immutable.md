#Tuples

A tuple is an immutable sequence of values.
- The values stored in a tuple can be any type.
- They are indexed by integers.
- Tuples are also *comparable* and *hashable* 
- So we can sort lists of them 
- and use tuples as key values in Python dictionaries

Syntactically, a tuple is a comma-separated list of values:
```python
t = 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e'         # Tuple
```
- Although not necessary, it is common to enclose tuples in parentheses to help us quickly identify them:
```python
t = ('a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e')       # Tuple
```

To create a tuple with a single element, you have to include the final comma:
```python
t1 = ('a',)
type(t1)
<type 'tuple'>
```

Without the comma Python treats ('a') as an expression with a string in parentheses that evaluates to a string:
```python
t2 = ('a')
type(t2)
<type 'str'>
```

Another way to construct a tuple is the built-in function **tuple**. With no arguments creates an empty tuple:
```python
t = tuple
print(t)
()
```

If the argument is a sequence (string, list, or tuple), the result of the call to tuple
Is a tuple with the elements of the sequence:
```python
t = tuple('lupins')
print(t)
('l', 'u', 'p', 'i', 'n', 's')
```

Most list operators also work on tuples. The bracket operator indexes an element:
```python
t = ('a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e')
print(t[0])
'a'
```

And the slice operator selects a range of elements:
```python
print(t[1:3])
('b', 'c')
```

But if you try to modify one of the elements of the tuple, you get an error:
```python
t[0] = 'A'
TypeError: object doesn't support item assignment
```

You can't modify the elements of a tuple, but you can replace one tuple with another:
```python
t = ('A',) + t[1:]
print(t)
('A', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e')
```
