#Debugging 
- Lists, dictionaries and tuples are known generically as *data structures*.
- In this chapter we started seeing compound data structures, like lists of tuples, and dictionaries that contain tuples as keys and lists as values.
- Compound data structures are useful, but prone to *shape errors*; errors caused when the data structure has the wrong type, size or composition.
- Or you introduce an error by forgetting the shape of your data.
- For example, if you are expecting a list with one integer and you get a plain integer (not a list), it wont work.
