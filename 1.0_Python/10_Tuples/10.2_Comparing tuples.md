#Tuples 

The comparison operators work with tuples and other sequences.
- Python starts by comparing the first element from each sequence.
- If they are equal, it goes to the next item and so on, until it finds elements that differ.
- Subsequent elements are not considered:
```python
(0, 1, 2) < (0, 3, 4)
True
(0, 1, 2000000) < (0, 3, 4)
True
```
- The **sort** function works the same way.
- It sorts primarily by first element, but in the case of a tie, it sorts by second element and so on.

This feature lends itself to a pattern called *DSU* for 
- **Decorate** a sequence by building a list of tuples with one or more sort keys preceding the elements from the sequence,
- **Sort** the list of tuples using the Python built-in **sort**, and
- **Undecorate** by extracting the sorted elements of the sequence.

For example, if you had a list of words and you want to sort them from longest to shortest:
```python
txt = 'but soft what light in yonder window breaks'
words = txt.split()
t = list()
for word in words:
    t.append((len(word), word))

t.sort(reverse=True)

res = list()
for length, word in t:
    res.append(word)

print(res)
```
-  The first loop builds a list of tuples, where each tuple is a word preceeded by its length.
- **sort** compares the first element, length, first, and only considers the second element to break ties.
- The keyword argument **reverse=True** tells **sort** to go in decreasing order.
- The second loop traverses the list of tuples and builds a list of words in decreasing order of length.
`Out:`
```
['yonder', 'window', 'breaks', 'light', 'what', 'soft', 'but', 'in']
```
