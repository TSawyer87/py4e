#Debugging 

You can bring up an interactive help system using `help()`.
```python
help()
```
`help> modules`

If you know what module you want to use, you can use the `dir()` command to find the methods in the module as follows:
```python
import re
dir(re)
```
`Out:`
```python
[.. 'compile', 'copy_reg', 'error', 'escape', 'findall',
'finditer' , 'match', 'purge', 'search', 'split', 'sre_compile',
'sre_parse' , 'sub', 'subn', 'sys', 'template']
```

- You can also get a small amount of documentation on a particular method using the dir command.
```python
import re
help(re.search)
```
`Out:`
```python
search(pattern, string, flags=0)
Scan through string looking for a match to the pattern, returning
a match object, or None if no match was found.
```
- The built-in documentation is not very extensive, but can be helpful when you're in a hurry or don't have access to a web browser or search engine.
