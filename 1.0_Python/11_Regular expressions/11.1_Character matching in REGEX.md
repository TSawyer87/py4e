#Regex

- The most commonly used special character is the period or full stop, which matches any character.

In the following, the regex `F..m:` would match any of the strings `From:, Fxxm:, F12m:, or F!@m:` since the period matches any character.
```python
# Search for lines that start with 'F', followed 
# by 2 characters, followed by 'm:'
import re
hand = open('mbox-short.txt')
for line in hand:
    line = line.rstrip()
    if re.search('^F..m:', line):
        print(line)
```
- This is particularly powerful when combined with the ability to indicate that a character can be repeated any number of times using the * or + characters.
- These special characters mean that instead of matching a single character in the search string, 
	- * matches zero-or-more characters
	- + matched one-or-more characters.

We can further narrow down the lines that we match using a repeated *wild card* character like this:
```python
# Search for lines that start with From and have an at sign.
import re
hand = open('mbox-short.txt')
for line in hand:
    line = line.strip()
    if re.search('^From:.+@', line):
        print(line)
```
- The search string `^From:.+@` will successfully match lines that start with "From".
- Followed by one or more characters (.+)
- Followed by an at sign, matching...
- `From: stephen.marquard@uct.ac.za`
	- You can think of the `.+` wildcard as expanding to match all characters between the colon and at-sign.
	- `From:.+@`

- It's good to think of the plus and asterisk characters as "pushy"
- For example, the following string would match the last at-sign in the string as the .+ pushes outwards, as shown:
`From: stephen.marquard@uct.ac.za, csev@umich.edu, and cwen@iupui.edu`
- The ? Makes it less greedy.
