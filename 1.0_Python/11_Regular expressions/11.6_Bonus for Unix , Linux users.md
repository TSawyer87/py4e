Support for searching files using regular expressions was built into the Unix operating system since the 1960 s and it is available in nearly all programming languages in one form or another.

As a matter of fact, there is a command-line program built into Unix called grep (Generalized Regular Expression Parser) that does pretty much the same as the search () examples in this chapter.
```bash
grep '^From:' mbox-short.txt
```
`Out:`
```bash
From: stephen.marquard@uct.ac.za
From: louis@media.berkeley.edu
From: zqian@umich.edu
From: rjlowe@iupui.edu
```
- This tells grep to show you lines that start with the string “From:” in the file `mbox-short.txt`. 
- If you experiment with the grep command a bit and read the documentation for grep, you will find some subtle differences between the regular expression support in Python and the regular expression support in grep. 
- As an example, grep does not support the non-blank character `\S` 
- so you will need to use the slightly more complex set notation `[ˆ ]`, which simply means match a character that is anything other than a space.
