#Regex 

- Since we use special characters in regular expressions to match the beginning or end of a line or specify wild cards, 
- we need a way to indicate that these characters are “normal” and we want to match the actual character such as a dollar sign or caret.

	We can indicate that we want to simply match a character by prefixing that character with a backslash.

For example, we can find money amounts with the following regex:
```python
import re
x = 'We just received $10.00 for cookies.'
y = re.findall('\$[0-9.]+', x)
print(y)
```
- Since we prefix the dollar sign with a backslash, it actually matches the dollar sign in the input instead of matching the "end of line",
- The rest of the regex matches one or more digits or the period character.
- Note: Inside square brackets, characters are not "special"
- So saying `[0-9.]`, it really means digits of a period.
- Outside of square brackets, a period is the "wildcard" character and matches any character.
