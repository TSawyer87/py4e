#Strings 

It is tempting to use the operator on the left side of an assignment, with the intention of changing a character in a string.:
```python
>>> greeting = 'Hello, world!'
>>> greeting[0] = 'J'
TypeError: 'str' object does not support assignment
```

- The "object" in this case is the string.
- The "item" is the character you tried to assign.
- For now, an *object* is the same thing as a value, but we will refine that later.
- An *item* is one of the values in a sequence.

The reason for the error is that strings are immutable, which means you canâ€™t change an existing string. The best you can do is create a new string that is a
Variation on the original:
```python
>>> greeting = 'Hello, world!'
>>> new_greeting = 'J' + greeting[1:]
>>> print(new_greeting)
Jello, world!
```
- This example concatenates a new first letter onto a slice of **greeting**. 
- It has no effect on the original string.
