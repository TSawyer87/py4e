```
word = 'banana'
count = 0
For letter in word:
    If letter == 'a':
        count = count + 1
Print (count)
```
This program demonstrates another pattern of computation called a counter. The
Variable count is initialized to 0 and then incremented each time an “a” is found.
When the loop exits, count contains the result: the total number of a’s.
Exercise 3: Encapsulate this code in a function named count, and generalize it so that it accepts the string and the letter as arguments.:
```
def letter_count(string, letter):
    """Counts the number of occurrances

    Args:
        string: The string to search in.
        letter: The letter to count occurances

    Returns:
        The number of times a letter appears.
    """
    count = 0
    for char in string:
        if char == letter:
            count += 1
    return count

# Example usage
word = 'banana'
letter = 'a'
result = letter_count(word, letter)
print(result)

**Explanation:**

1. **Function Definition:**
    
    - `def letter_count(string, letter):` Defines a function named `letter_count` that takes two arguments:
        - `string`: The string to search for the letter occurrences.
        - `letter`: The specific letter to count.
2. **Docstring (Optional but Recommended):**
    
    - `"""Counts the number of occurrences of a specific letter in a string."""` (triple quoted strings) adds a docstring explaining the function's purpose and arguments.
3. **Initialization:**
    
    - `count = 0`: Initializes a variable `count` to 0 to keep track of the number of letter occurrences.
4. **Loop:**
    
    - `for char in string:` Iterates over each character (`char`) in the `string` argument.
5. **Conditional Check (Improved):**
    
    - `if char == letter:` This condition checks if the current character (`char`) in the loop iteration is equal to the target `letter` provided as an argument. This is the correction we made. Previously, it was checking `if letter in string` which is always True since you're iterating over the characters in `string` anyway.
6. **Counting:**
    
    - `count += 1`: If the condition is True (current character matches the target letter), the `count` is incremented by 1.
7. **Return Value:**
    
    - `return count`: After the loop finishes iterating through all characters, the function returns the final value of `count`, which represents the number of times the target `letter` appeared in the `string`.
8. **Example Usage:**
    
    - Demonstrates how to call the `letter_count` function with a string "banana" and letter 'a', storing the result in the `result` variable.
    - Prints the result (which will be 3).
