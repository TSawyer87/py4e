#Strings 

A string is a *sequence* of characters.
- You can access the characters one at a time with the bracket operator:
```
>>> fruit = 'banana'
>>> letter = fruit[1] # extract character at 
                      # index pos 1.

>>> print(letter)
a
```

In Python, the index is offset from the beginning of the string, and the offset of the first letter is zero.
```
>>> letter = fruit[0]
>>> print(letter)
b
```
- So "b" is the 0 th letter ("zero-th") of "banana", "a" is the 1 th letter ("one-th"), and "n" is the 2 th ("two-th") letter.

You can use any expression, including variables and operators, as an index, but the value of the index has to be an integer. Otherwise you get:
```
letter = fruit[1:5]
TypeError: string indices must be integers
```

```
 b     a     n     a    n    a
[0]   [1]   [2]   [3]  [4]  [5]
```
