#Strings 

The following program counts the number of times the letter “a” appears in a string:
```
word = 'banana'
count = 0
for letter in word:
    if letter == 'a':
        count = count + 1
print(count)

3
```

- This is another pattern of computation called a *counter*.
- The variable **count** is initialized to 0 and then incremented each time an "a" is found.
- When the loop exits, **count** contains the result: the total number of a's.
