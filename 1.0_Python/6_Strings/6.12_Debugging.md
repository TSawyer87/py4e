#Debugging 

A skill that you should cultivate as you program is always asking yourself:
- What could go wrong here?
- What crazy thing might our user do to crash our (seemingly) perfect program?

For example:
```python
while True:
    line = input('> ')
    if line[0] == '#':
        continue
    if line == 'done':
        break
    print(line)
print('Done!')
```

Look what happens when the user enters an empty line of input:
```python
> hello there
hello there
> # don't print this
> print this!
print this!
>
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "copytildone.py", line 3, in <module>
if line[0] == '#':
IndexError: string index out of range
```

- There is no zero-th character, so we get a traceback.
There are two solutions to this to make line three "safe" even if the line is empty:
```python
if line.startswith('#')
```

Another way is to write the **if** statement using the *guardian* pattern and make sure the second logical expression is evaluated only where there is at least one character in the string:
```python
if len(line) > 0 and line[0] == '#':
```
