- Strings are an example of Python *objects*.
- An object contains both data (the actual string itself) and *methods*, which are effectively functions that are built into the object and are available to any *instance* of the object.
- Python has a function called **dir** which lists the methods available for an object.
- The **type** function shows the type of an object and the **dir** function shows the available methods.
```
>>> stuff = 'Hello world'
>>> type(stuff)
<class 'str'>
>>> dir(stuff)
['capitalize', 'casefold', 'center', 'count', 'encode',
'endswith' , 'expandtabs', 'find', 'format', 'format_map',
'index' , 'isalnum', 'isalpha', 'isdecimal', 'isdigit',
'isidentifier' , 'islower', 'isnumeric', 'isprintable',
'isspace' , 'istitle', 'isupper', 'join', 'ljust', 'lower',
'lstrip' , 'maketrans', 'partition', 'replace', 'rfind',
'rindex' , 'rjust', 'rpartition', 'rsplit', 'rstrip',
'split' , 'splitlines', 'startswith', 'strip', 'swapcase',
'title' , 'translate', 'upper', 'zfill']
>>> help(str.capitalize)
Help on method_descriptor:
capitalize(...)
S.capitalize() -> str
Return a capitalized version of S, i.e. make the first character
have upper case and the rest lower case.
>>>
```

- While the **dir** function lists the methods, and you can use help to get some simple documentation on a method, a better source of documentation for string methods
would be https://docs.python.org/library/stdtypes.html#string-methods.

- Calling a *method* is similar to calling a function ( it takes an argument and returns a value) but the syntax is different.
- We call a method by appending the method name to the variable name using dot notation.

For example, the method **upper**:
```
>>> word = 'banana'
>>> new_word = word.upper()
>>> print(new_word)
BANANA
```

- This dot notation specifies the name of the method, **upper**.

- The name of the string to apply the method to, **word**.
- The empty parentheses indicate that this method takes no argument.
- A method call is called an *invocation*; in this case, we would say that we are invoking **upper** on **word**.

There is a string method named **find** that searches for the position of one string within another:
```
>>> word = 'banana'
>>> index = word.find('a')
>>> print(index) 
1
```
- Here we invoke **find** on **word** and pass the letter we are looking for as a parameter

 The **find** method can find substrings as well as characters:
 ```
 >>> word.find('na')
 2
 
 # it can as a second argument the index to start at.
 >>> word.find('na', 3)
 4
 ```

One common task is to remove white space (spaces, tabs, or newlines) from the beginning and end of a string using the **strip** method:
```
>>> line = '  Here we go  '
>>> line.strip()
'Here we go'
```


Some methods such as *startswith* return boolean values:
```
>>> line = 'Have a nice day'
>>> line.startswith('Have')
True
>>> line.startswith('h')
False
```

You will note that startswith requires case to match, so sometimes we take a line and map it all to lowercase before we do any checking using the lower method.
```
>>> line = 'Have a nice day'
>>> line.startswith('h')
False
>>> line.lower()
'have a nice day'
>>> line.lower().startswith('h')
True
```

- Here **lower** is called and then we use **startswith** to see if the resulting lowercase string starts with "h".
- As long as you're careful with the order, you can make multiple method calls in a single expression.
