#Strings 

**len** is a built-in function that returns the number of characters in a string:
```
>>> fruit = 'banana'
>>> len(fruit)
6
```

Since we start at 0 the index for "banana" is 0 to 5.

To get the last character, you have to subtract 1 from length:
```
>>> last = fruit[length-1]
>>> print(last)
a
# or
fruit[-1]    # last number
a
fruit[-2]    # 2nd to last number
n
```
