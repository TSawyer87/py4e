#Strings 

Often, we want to look into a string and find a substring.
For example if we were presented a series of lines formatted as follows:
```python
From stephen.marquard@uct.ac.za Sat Jan 5 09:14:16 2008
```

- And we wanted to pull out only the second half of the address (uct. Ac. Za.) from each line, we can do this by using the **find** method and string slicing.
- First, find the position of the at-sign in the string.
- Then we will find the position of the first space *after* the at-sign.
- Lastly we will use string slicing to extract the position of the string we are looking for.
```python
>>> data = 'From stephen.marquard@uct.ac.za Sat Jan
 5 09:14:16 2008'
>>> atpos = data.find('@')
>>> print(atpos)
21
>>> sppos = data.find(' ',atpos)
>>> print(sppos)
31
>>> host = data[atpos+1:sppos]
>>> print(host)
uct.ac.za
>>>
```
- We use a version of the **find** method which allows us to specify a position in the string where we want **find** to start looking.
- When we slice, we extract the characters from "one beyond the at-sign through up to *but not including* the space character".
