#Strings 

A lot of computations involve processing a string one character at a time.
- Often they start at the beginning, select each character in turn, do something to it, and continue until the end.

This pattern of processing is called *traversal*. One way to write a traversal is with a **while** loop:
```python
fruit = 'fruit'

index = 0
while index < len(fruit):
    letter = fruit[index]
    print(letter)
    index = index + 1

f
r
u
i
t
```
- This loop traverses the string and displays each letter on a line by itself.
- The loop condition is **index** < **len(fruit)**, so when **index** is equal to the length of the string, the condition is false, and the body of the loop is not executed.
- The last character accessed is the one with the index **len(fruit)-1**, which is the last character in the string.

To reverse the string "fruit":
```python
fruit = "fruit"
# Method 1: Slicing (Simple and efficient) 

reversed_fruit = fruit[::-1] print(reversed_fruit)

tiurf

# Method 2: Loop (Iterating from the end) 

reversed_fruit = "" for index in range(len(fruit) - 1, -1, -1): reversed_fruit += fruit[index] print(reversed_fruit)  

tiurf
```
**Explanation:**

1. **Method 1: Slicing (Recommended):**
    
    - Python string slicing allows you to extract a portion of a string using start, stop, and step arguments.
    - In this case, `fruit[::-1]` specifies:
        - Empty start index (`:`): starts from the beginning.
        - Empty stop index (`:`): goes until the end.
        - Step of -1 (`-1`): iterates from the end towards the beginning, effectively reversing the string.
2. **Method 2: Loop (for educational purposes):**
    
    - This method iterates through the string in reverse order using a loop.
    - `range(len(fruit) - 1, -1, -1)` creates a sequence of indices starting from the last index (`len(fruit) - 1`) down to -1 (not including -1) with a step of -1 (decrementing).
    - In each iteration, the character at the current index (`fruit[index]`) is added to the `reversed_fruit` string using string concatenation (`+=`).

Both methods achieve the same result of printing the reversed string "tiurf". Method 1 (slicing) is generally considered more concise and efficient for string reversal in Python.
