The comparison operators work on strings. To see if two strings are equal:
```
if word == 'banana':
    print('All right, bananas.')
```

Other comparison operations are useful for putting words in alphabetical order:)
```
word = 'Pineapple'

if word < 'banana':
    print('Your word, ' + word + ', comes before banana.')
elif word > 'banana':
    print('Your word, ' + word + ', comes after banana.')
else:
    print('All right, bananas.')
```


- Python doesn't handle uppercase and lowercase letters the same way people do.
- All uppercase letters come before all the lowercase letters, so:

```
Your word, Pineapple, comes before banana.
```
- A common way to address this problem is to convert strings to a standard format, such as all lowercase, before performing the comparison.
-  Keep that in mind in case you have to defend yourself against a man armed with a Pineapple.

```
word = "Pineapple"  # Set the word to compare

# Convert the word to lowercase for case-insensitive comparison
word = word.lower()

if word < 'banana':
  print('Your word, ' + word + ', comes before banana.')
elif word > 'banana':
  print('Your word, ' + word + ', comes after banana.')
else:
  print('All right, bananas.')

```

```
Your word, pineapple, comes after banana.
```
**Explanation:**

1. **Lowercase Conversion:**
    
    - The line `word = word.lower()` converts the value stored in the variable `word` to lowercase using the `lower()` method. This ensures the comparison is case-insensitive.
2. **Comparison:**
    
    - The `if` and `elif` statements now compare the lowercase version of `word` with 'banana'. This means "pineapple" (lowercase) will be compared to "banana" (lowercase), resulting in an accurate alphabetical order check.

With this modification, the code will function the same way regardless of the case of the user-defined word (`"Pineapple"` or `"pineapple"`).
