The *format operator*, % allows us to construct strings, replace parts of the strings with the data stored in variables
- When applied to integers, % is the modulus operator.
- But when the first operand is a string, % is the format operator.

- The first operand is the *format string*, which contains one or more *format sequences* that specify how the second operand is formatted. The result is a string.

The format sequence %d means the second operand should be formatted as an integer ("d" stands for "decimal"):
```
>>> camels = 42
>>> '%d' % camels
'42'
```

A format sequence can appear anywhere in the string, so you can embed a value in a sentence:
```
>>> camels = 42
>>> 'I have spotted %d camels.' % camels
'I have spotted 42 camels.'
```
- If there is more than one format sequence in the string, the second argument has to be a tuple.
- Each format sequence is matched with an element of the tuple, in order.

The following example uses %d to format an integer, %g to format a floating-point number (donâ€™t ask why), and %s to format a string:
```
>>> 'In %d years I have spotted %g %s.' % (3, 0.1, 'camels')
'In 3 years I have spotted 0.1 camels.'
```

The number of elements in the tuple must match the number of format sequences in the string. 

The types of elements also must match the format sequences:
```
>>> '%d %d %d' % (1, 2)
TypeError: not enough arguments for format string
>>> '%d' % 'dollars'
TypeError: %d format: a number is required, not str
```
- In the first example there aren't enough elements.
- In the second, the element is the wrong type.
