- Deterministic: Given the same inputs, most computer programs generate the same output every time, so they are said to be *deterministic*
- Determinism is usually a good thing, but sometimes we want the computer to be unpredictable..
- The **random** module provides functions that generate pseudorandom numbers.
- The function **random** returns a random float between 0.0 and 1.0 (including 0.0 but not 1.0).
- Each time you call **random** , you get the next number in a long series:
```python
import random

for i in range(10):
    x = random.random()
    print(x)

0.5004843456258053
0.4963184858348664
0.071029115069706
0.0220634335987554
0.6076024453719147
0.16799932363268377
0.9847706318486316
0.5510189672362719
0.2221922455482569
0.5807623966398427

```
- The **random** function is only one of many functions that handle random numbers.
- The function **randint** takes the parameters **low** and **high** , and returns an integer between low and high (including both).
```python
>>> random.randint(5, 10)
5
>>> random.randint(5, 10)
9
```

- To choose an element from a sequence at random, you can use **choice**:
```python
>>> t = [1, 2, 3]
>>> random.choice(t)
2
>>> random.choice(t)
3
```
- The random module also provides functions to generate random values from continuous distributions including Gaussian, exponential, gamma, and a few more.
