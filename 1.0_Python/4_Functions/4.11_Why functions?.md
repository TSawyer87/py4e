#Functions 

There are several reasons why its worth the trouble of breaking your program into functions:
-  Creating a new function gives you an opportunity to name a group of statements, which makes your program easier to read, understand, and debug.
- Functions git rid of repetitive code making your programs smaller.
- If you want to make a change later, you only have to change it in one place.
- Dividing a long program into functions allows you to debug parts one at a time and then assemble them into a working whole.
- Well-designed functions are often useful for many programs. Once you write and debug one, you can reuse it.

Part of the skill of creating and using functions is to have a function properly capture an idea such as “find the smallest value in a list of values”.
