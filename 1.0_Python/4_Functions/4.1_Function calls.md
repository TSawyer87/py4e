#Functions

- In the context of programming, a function is a named sequence of statements that  performs a computation.
- When you define a function, you specify the name and the sequence of statements.
- Later, you can "call" the function by name.
```python
>>> type(32)
<class 'int'>
```
- The name of the function is type.
- The expression in parentheses is called the *argument* of the function.
- The argument is a value or variable that we are passing into the function as input to the function
- The result, for the type function, is the type of the argument.
- It's common to say that a function "takes" an argument and "returns" a result. The result is called the *return value*
