#Functions 
- Pulling together the code fragments from the previous section, the whole program looks like this:
```
def print_lyrics():  
    print("I'm a lumberjack, and I'm okay.") 
    print('I sleep all night and I work all day.')   

def repeat_lyrics():  
    print_lyrics()  
    print_lyrics()  

repeat_lyrics()
I'm a lumberjack, and I'm okay.
I sleep all night and I work all day.
I'm a lumberjack, and I'm okay.
I sleep all night and I work all day.
```
- This program contains two function definitions: **print_lyrics** and **repeat_lyrics**.
- Function definitions get executed just like other statements, but the effect is to create function objects.
- The statements inside the function do not get executed until the function is called, and the function generates no output.
