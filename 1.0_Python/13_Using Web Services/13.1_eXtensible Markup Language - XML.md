#XML

Once it became easy to retrieve documents and parse docs over HTTP using programs, it didn't take long to develop an approach where we started producing docs that were specifically designed to be consumed by other programs (i.e. not HTML to be displayed in a browser)
- Two common formats used when exchanging data across the web are:
	- `eXtensible Markup Language (XML)` has been in use for a very long time and is best suited for exchanging document-style data.
	- `JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)` is used when programs just want to exchange dictionaries, lists, or other internal information with each other.

We will explore XML first, XML looks very similar to HTML, but XML is more structured than HTML. 

Here is an example of XML:
```XML
<person>
  <name>Chuck</name>
  <phone type="intl">
    +1 734 303 4456
  </phone>
  <email hide="yes" />
</person>
```
- Each pair of opening (e.g., `<person>`) and closing tags ` </person> ` represents an *element* or *node* with the same name as the tag (e.g. `person`)
- Each element can have some text, some attributes (e.g. `hide`) and other nested elements.
- If an XML element is empty, then it may be depicted by a self-closing tag (e.g., `<email />).
