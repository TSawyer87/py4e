- We now have the ability to exchange data between applications using HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP)
- A way to represent complex data that we are sending back and forth between these applications using eXtensible Markup Language (XML) or JavaScript Object Notation (JSON).

- The next step is to begin to define and document "contracts" between apps using these techniques.
- These application-to-application constructs are called *Application Program Interfaces(APIs)*
- When we use an API, generally one program makes a set of *services* available for use by other applications and publishes the APIs "rules" that must be followed to access the service provided by the program.

- When our programs functionality includes access to services provided by other programs, this is called *Service-oriented architecture (SOA)*
- A SOA approach is one where our overall application makes use of the services of other apps.
- A non-SOA approach is where the app is a single standalone app which contains all of the code necessary to implement the application.

A Service-oriented architecture has many advantages, including:
1. We always maintain only one copy of data (this is very important for things like hotel reservations where we don't want to over-commit)
2. The owners of the data can set the rules about the use of that data.
With these advantages, an SOA system must be carefully designed to have good performance and meet te user's needs.
