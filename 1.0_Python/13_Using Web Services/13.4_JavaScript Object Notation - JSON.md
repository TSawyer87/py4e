#JSON

- The JSON format was inspired by the object and array format used in the JavaScript language.
- Since Python was invented before JavaScript, Python's syntax for dictionaries and lists influenced the syntax of JSON.
- So the format of JSON is nearly identical to a combination of Python lists and dictionaries.

Here is a JSON encoding that is roughly equivalent to the simple XML from 13.3:
```JSON
{
    "name" : "Chuck",
    "phone" : {
      "type" : "intl",
      "number" : "+1 734 303 4456"
      },
      "email", {
        "hide" : "yes"
        }
}
```
- There are some differences, First, in XML, we can add attributes like "intl" to the "phone" tag.
- In JSON, we simply have key-value pairs.
- Also the XML "person" tag is gone, replaced by a set of outer curly braces.

- In general, JSON structures are simpler than XML because JSON has fewer capabilities than XML.
- JSON has the advantage that it maps *directly* to some combination of dictionaries and lists.
- Since nearly all programming languages have something equivalent to Pythons dictionaries and lists, JSON is a very natural format to have two cooperation programs exchange data.

- JSON is quickly becoming the format of choice for nearly all data exchange between applications because of its relative simplicity compared to XML
