#XML 

Here is an app that parses some XML and extracts some data elements:
```XML
import xml.etree.ElementTree as ET

data = '''
<person>
  <name>Chuck</name>
  <phone type="intl">
    +1 734 303 4456
  </phone>
  <email hide="yes" />
</person>'''

tree = ET.fromstring(data)
print('Name:', tree.find('name').text)
print('Attr:', tree.find('email').get('hide'))
```
- The tripple single quote ('''), as well as the triple double quote (""") allow for the creation of strings that span multiple lines.
- The `fromstring` converts the string representation of the XML into a "tree" of XML elements.
- When the XML is in a tree, we have a series of methods we can call to extract portions of data from the XML string.
- The `find` function searches through the XML tree and retrieves the element that matches the specified tag
- `Out:`
```XML
Name: Chuck
Attr: yes
```
- Using an XML parser such as `ElementTree` has the advantage the while the XML in this example is quite simple, it turns out there are many rules regarding valid XML, and using `ElementTree` allows us to extract data from XML without worrying about the rules of XML syntax.
