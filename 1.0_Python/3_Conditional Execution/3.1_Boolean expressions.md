- A *boolean expression* is an expression that is either true or false.
- The following  examples use the operator = =, which compares two operands and produces True if  they are equal and False otherwise:
```
>>> 5 == 5
True
>>> 5 == 6
False
>>> type(True)
<class 'bool'>
>>> type(False)
<class 'bool'>
```


The (= =)  operator is one of the *comparison* operators; the others are:
```
x != y       # x is not equal to y
x > y        # x is greater than y
x < y        # x is less than y
x >= y       # x is greater than or equal to y
x <= y       # x is less than or equal to y
x is y       # x is the same as y
x is not y   # x is not the same as y
```

- **Remember**: = is an assignment operator and = = is a comparison operator.
- There is no such thing as =< or =>.
