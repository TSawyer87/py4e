A second form of the if statement is *alternative execution*, in which there are two possibilities and the condition determines which one gets executed.

The syntax looks like this:
```python
if x%2 == 0 :  
    print('x is even')  # if the remainder when x is divided by 2 is 
else :                  # 0, then we know x is even
    print('x is odd')
```
- Since the condition must be either true or false, exactly one of the alternatives will be executed.
- The alternatives are called *branches* because they are branches in the flow of execution.
