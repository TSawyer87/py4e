In Lua, the statement that every function is a closure refers to a fundamental concept in the language: **lexical scoping** combined with **first-class functions**. Here's a breakdown:

**Lexical Scoping:**

- In Lua, functions inherit access to local variables from the enclosing function or code block where they were defined. This is called lexical scoping because it's determined by the structure of your code (where the function is written) rather than when it's called.
- Unlike some other languages, Lua doesn't require explicit declarations to access these local variables from within the inner function.

**First-Class Functions:**

- Lua treats functions as first-class values. This means you can:
    - Assign functions to variables
    - Pass functions as arguments to other functions
    - Return functions from other functions

**Closures: The Marriage of Lexical Scoping and First-Class Functions**

- When a function is created within another function in Lua, it becomes a closure. This closure captures the local variables from its enclosing scope, even if the enclosing function has already finished executing.
- When you call the closure (the inner function), it can still access and use those captured local variables, even though they might not be in the current scope anymore.

**Benefits of Closures in Lua:**

- Closures provide a powerful way to create functions that remember state or context.
- They can be used to implement iterators, private variables (by storing them in the closure's captured variables), and other advanced programming patterns.

**Here's an example to illustrate:**

Lua

```lua
function createAdder(initialValue)
  local count = initialValue  -- local variable captured by the inner function

  function add(value)
    count = count + value
    return count
  end

  return add  -- return the inner function (the closure)
end

-- Create an adder starting at 5
adder = createAdder(5)

-- Call the closure multiple times, it remembers 'count'
print(adder(3))  -- Output: 8
print(adder(2))  -- Output: 10
```

Use code [with caution.](https://gemini.google.com/faq#coding)

In this example, the `createAdder` function creates a closure. The inner function `add` captures the local variable `count` from its enclosing scope. Even after `createAdder` finishes executing, the closure remembers the value of `count` and can modify it across multiple calls.

**Scopes and Closures in Lua:

**

- **Scopes:** In Lua, scopes define the visibility of variables. Each function, block of code defined with `do ... end`, or the global environment has its own scope. Variables declared within a scope are only accessible within that scope (unless explicitly passed or returned).
- **Closures:** As explained earlier, closures are functions that capture variables from their enclosing scope, even if the enclosing scope has finished executing. This allows the inner function to access variables that would normally be out of its reach.

**Why Every Scope Isn't a Closure:**

- Not every function defined within a scope becomes a closure. A function becomes a closure only if it needs to access variables from its enclosing scope. If a function doesn't rely on any variables outside its own scope, it's just a regular function and doesn't capture any variables.

**Here's an analogy:**

- Imagine a library (the enclosing scope). It has different sections (inner scopes) containing books (variables).
- A librarian (a closure) can borrow a book (variable) from their section (scope) and take it with them (even if the library closes). However, not every librarian needs to borrow a book â€“ some might just work within their section and not need anything from outside.

**Key Points:**

- Lexical scoping allows functions to access variables from their enclosing scope.
- Closures are a specific type of function that captures variables from their enclosing scope.
- Not every function within a scope becomes a closure.
