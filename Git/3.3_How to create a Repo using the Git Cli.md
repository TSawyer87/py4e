#Git 
To create a new `repository` using the command line, you need to follow these steps:

1. Open your terminal and navigate to the directory where you want to create your new repository.
    
2. Use the `git init` command to create a new repository. This command will create a new directory called `.git` in your current directory, which will contain all the necessary files for your repository.
```
# Initialize a new repo called my-project
git init my-project
```
The image above shows the command to initialize a new repository called my-project.

3. Once you have created your new repository, you can start adding files and making changes to it. You can also connect your local repository to a remote repository on GitHub by following the instructions provided on the GitHub website.

Congratulations! You have successfully created a new repository using the command line.
