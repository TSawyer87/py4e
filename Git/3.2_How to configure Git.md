#Git 

Git offers a variety of configurations that can streamline your workflow. In this section, I will guide you through the process of setting up Git on your local machine. Let's get started.

Configuring your `name` and `email` address on your local machine is an essential step in setting up Git. These details are attached to each commit you make, providing context and ownership. Let's learn how to use the `git config --global` command to set your name and email globally on your local machine.

To set up your name, you need to type the following command in your terminal:
```
git config --global user.name "TSawyer87"
git config --global user.email "sawyerjr.25@gmail.com"
```

Now that we have finished setting up your username and email for Git and GitHub, let's verify that everything is configured correctly.

To do this, use the following command:
```
git config --global --list .
```
This command will list the username and email being used in the console for you to see.

You should see some information displayed in your terminal

 How to Set the Default Editor

In modern development, having a code editor can significantly simplify your workflow, especially when you're focused on coding.

Now, let's see how to configure Git to use a default editor by using this command:
```
git config --global core.editor "code --wait"
```
Congratulations! You have successfully configured Git on your local machine. You are now ready to start using Git for your projects.
