To connect your local repository to a remote repository on GitHub, you need to follow these steps:

1. On GitHub, navigate to the main page of the repository you created earlier.
    
2. Click on the `Code` button to copy the URL of your repository.

3. In your terminal, navigate to the directory of your local repository.
    
4. Use the `git remote add origin` command to connect your local repository to the remote repository on GitHub. Replace repository-URL with the URL of your repository.
```
git remote add origin <repository-url>
```

5. Once you have connected your local repository to the remote repository on GitHub, you can start pushing your changes to the remote repository using the `git push` command.
Congratulations! You have successfully connected your local repository to the remote repository on GitHub.
